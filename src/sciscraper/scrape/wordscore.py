    """
    RelevanceCalculator contains all the variables necessary to calculate the `wordscore` of a paper or abstract.

    Attributes
    ----------
    pos_part : float
        The number of times a target word appeared in the paper or abstract.
    neg_part : float
        The number of times a bycatch word appeared in the paper or abstract.
    pos_changes : int
        The total number of target words from the set.
    neg_chances : int
        The total number of bycatch words from the set.
    total_len : int
        The total number of words in the paper or abstract.

    Methods
    -------
    __call__ : returns wordscore value as a float

    def __call__(self) -> float:
        """Calculate the relevance of the paper, or abstract, as a percentage.

        Variables
        -------
        WEIGHT : float
            Constant. Prevents abstracts from being over-represented.
        pos_odds : float
            The odds that a target word appeared.
        neg_odds : float
            The odds that a bycatch word appeared.
        len_factor : float
            An additional variable designed to keep abstracts
            from being over-represented.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The probability that the paper is relevant, as a percentage.

        Note
        ----
        `len_factor` is the probability of any match occuring,
        accounting for total number of words analyzed. The more
        words in the sample, then the higher the likelihood that
        the paper is a match.
        If the ratio between the total odds
        (i.e. `pos_odds` + `neg_odds`)
        and the total words (i.e. `total_len`) is very small,
        (e.g. 1:10000), then:
        >>> 1 - (0.0001 * 0.75) = 1 - 0.0075 â‰ˆ 1
        If the preliminary odds-to-probability score is say, 75%,
        then it's going to still be roughly 75% afterwards.
        But if that ratio were larger, (e.g. 0.3), then:
        >>> 1 - (0.3 * 0.75) = 1 - .225 = .775
        That score, when applied to our 75% preliminary score,
        is going to be nearly three-fourths of
        what it was, or roughly 66%.
