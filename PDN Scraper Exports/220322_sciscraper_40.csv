0,Applied Behavior Analysis and Social Marketing: An Integration for Environmental Preservation,E. Scott Geller,Wiley,1989-04,10.1111/j.1540-4560.1989.tb01531.x,pub.1033781069,"Basic principles of applied behavior analysis and social marketing are reviewed with reference to the development of action plans to protect the environment. Behavior-change procedures that have targeted environmental preservation are categorized as antecedent interventions (including education, prompting, modeling, goal setting and commitment, and engineering and design strategies) or consequence procedures (i.e., reinforcement and punishment). Although past behavior analysis research has demonstrated environmental benefits from applying certain behavior-change interventions, those studies were small-scale and short-lived. This paper offers an integrative model of applied behavior analysis and social marketing as a potential approach to large-scale and long-term intervention for environmental protection. The market analysis and segmentation phases of social marketing, for example, allow for the specialization of behavior-change strategies for particular target groups. This integration requires increased collaboration between behavior analysts and environmental psychologists who study the correlation of individuals' environmental concern and action with their attitudinal, demographic, and personality characteristics. A plea is made to replace armchair theorizing with interdisciplinary and intervention-focused environmental research.",,Journal of Social Issues,45,1,155,,"['pub.1090366810', 'pub.1020378398', 'pub.1017441123', 'pub.1110432763', 'pub.1058579195', 'pub.1014276234', 'pub.1017377476', 'pub.1018743681', 'pub.1044021258', 'pub.1036634526', 'pub.1024368052', 'pub.1031563563', 'pub.1027485254', 'pub.1010711255', 'pub.1016268071', 'pub.1007968555', 'pub.1007718244', 'pub.1000635001', 'pub.1002973666', 'pub.1007176029', 'pub.1000552121', 'pub.1011762497', 'pub.1019658032', 'pub.1029664017', 'pub.1020860070', 'pub.1085933014', 'pub.1038006166', 'pub.1012071573', 'pub.1048769463', 'pub.1037226530', 'pub.1069415659', 'pub.1013982715', 'pub.1069417317', 'pub.1019728764', 'pub.1022891723', 'pub.1047119010', 'pub.1069278079', 'pub.1034520045', 'pub.1011365597', 'pub.1016022549', 'pub.1040020976', 'pub.1029659265', 'pub.1002820121', 'pub.1110045511']",Behavior Analysis and Environmental Protection: Accomplishments and Potential for More

It also provided an opportunity to study attitude change. Results indicated that residents making a written commitment were more likely to participate (and to participate more than once) than those who learned about the program face-to-face, by telephone, or from only a flyer (all residents received the flyer; the signature-commitment and face-to-face groups also received telephone calls to prepare them for the experimenter's visit). Although groups had similar recycling histories—and by implication similar prior attitudes—those who participated had more favorable attitudes after 4 months than those who did not participate. In contrast to research showing that commitment could lead to behavior without corresponding changes in attitudes, the data supported the view that commitment and behavior can lead to changes in attitudes. The study sets the stage for systematic examination of the hypothesis that at first commitment leads to behavior without attitude change, but over time, if the behavior continues, attitude change occurs.",,Journal of Environmental Psychology,15,3,70,,"['pub.1043773634', 'pub.1053349945', 'pub.1037618143', 'pub.1003660452', 'pub.1004308877', 'pub.1042824146', 'pub.1017753224', 'pub.1047264406', 'pub.1021073723', 'pub.1025674445', 'pub.1043847598', 'pub.1069860280', 'pub.1025688619', 'pub.1002995927', 'pub.1046036520', 'pub.1018068391', 'pub.1069280024', 'pub.1037755275', 'pub.1040801089', 'pub.1019300533', 'pub.1034520045']",Behavior Analysis and Environmental Protection: Accomplishments and Potential for More

Results of both studies supported the assumption that furnishing a goal intention with an additional implementation intention significantly increases the likelihood of actually performing the intended new behaviour. In the second study, the implementation intention intervention is combined with receiving a small vs higher monetary incentive. Receiving the higher incentive has similar behavioural effects to forming an implementation intention, whereas combining both interventions does not result in a stronger behavioural reaction. These results indicate that the behavioural effect of a higher monetary incentive might relay a similar volitional process to that of the implementation intention.

To date, however, most programs promoting sustainable behavior have featured information-intensive campaigns that make little use of psychological knowledge. Community-based social marketing is an attractive alternative approach in which promoters identify the activity to be promoted and the barriers to this activity and then design a strategy to overcome these barriers, using psychological knowledge regarding behavior change. The strategy is piloted to test its effectiveness and later evaluated when it is implemented on a broader scale. Unlike many information-intensive campaigns, community-based social marketing has been shown to have a much greater probability of promoting sustainable behavior. Two case studies are provided to illustrate the approach and its possible results.",,American Psychologist,55,5,343,"['Community Participation', 'Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Marketing of Health Services', 'Social Behavior']","['pub.1033781069', 'pub.1048209249', 'pub.1069271320', 'pub.1058528459', 'pub.1067629722', 'pub.1024566710', 'pub.1010711255', 'pub.1018510388', 'pub.1025552647', 'pub.1040920241', 'pub.1047004250', 'pub.1026516285', 'pub.1014263360', 'pub.1046623891', 'pub.1051005690', 'pub.1033066989', 'pub.1035701425', 'pub.1011275907', 'pub.1004866593', 'pub.1034520045', 'pub.1070710809']",Behavior Analysis and Environmental Protection: Accomplishments and Potential for More

The studies assessed the effectiveness of videotape modeling programs that demonstrated these conservation strategies when used alone or combined with daily feedback on electricity use. In the winter, the results indicated that videotape modeling and/or feedback were effective relative to baseline and to a control group in reducing overall electricity use by about 15% and electricity used for heating by about 25%. Hygrothermographs, which accurately and continuously recorded temperature and humidity in the homes, indicated that participants were able to live with no reported loss in comfort and no change in attire at a mean temperature of about 62 degrees F when home and about 59 degrees F when asleep. The results were highly discrepant with prior laboratory studies indicating comfort at 75 degrees F with the insulation value of the clothing worn by participants in this study. In the summer, a combination of strategies designed to keep a home cool with minimal or no air conditioning, in conjunction with videotape modeling and/or daily feedback, resulted in overall electricity reductions of about 15% with reductions on electricity for cooling of about 34%, but with feedback, and feedback and modeling more effective than modeling alone. Despite these electricity savings, hygrothermograph recordings indicated minimal temperature change in the homes, with no change in perceived comfort or clothing worn. The results are discussed in terms of discrepancies with laboratory studies, optimal combinations of video-media and personal contact to promote behavior change, and energy policies that may be mislabeled as sacrificial and underestimate the effectiveness of conservation strategies such as those investigated in these studies.",,Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis,15,3,80,,"['pub.1046053530', 'pub.1062646798', 'pub.1058528459', 'pub.1030731574', 'pub.1007968555', 'pub.1062230915', 'pub.1069271355', 'pub.1025446875', 'pub.1069276085', 'pub.1013788676', 'pub.1001670018', 'pub.1016052468', 'pub.1062229446', 'pub.1004571055', 'pub.1037226530', 'pub.1016739902', 'pub.1069271287', 'pub.1022891723', 'pub.1043196149', 'pub.1001593503', 'pub.1020982095']",Behavior Analysis and Environmental Protection: Accomplishments and Potential for More

Fifty-four studies were categorized and evaluated according to which of these taxonomic interventions were reported. The conclusions were that (a) antecedent conditions using commitment, demonstration, and goal-setting strategies were generally most effective in encouraging environmentally responsible behavior, and (b) consequence conditions were effective in producing behavior change during the experiment's duration. However, some other important findings were that (a) much of the research in this field during the 1980s did not directly compare interventions, (b) few meaningful follow-up measures were reported, and those evaluations that included follow-up assessment showed little maintenance of the behavior changes, and (c) many potentially effective intervention strategies have been ignored (i.e., group interventions and penalties).

An experimental design investigated four behavior change techniques: biweekly postcards giving specific feedback to each dwelling unit as to quantity and contamination of the recyclables, newsletters giving general information on recycling and the amount recycled by the city as a whole, written pledges committing households to recycle for a specified period, and volunteer coordinators who distributed information and answered questions from residents. The effectiveness of these techniques was compared against that of a control group. The findings suggest that volunteer coordinators are not an effective intervention technique in multi-family dwellings, and that feedback and commitment techniques are useful mainly for managing contamination in medium sized complexes. The data also suggest that the size of a multi-family dwelling complex significantly affects the amount of recyclables collected and the level of contamination. Smaller complexes with less than ten units recycled up to three times the amount on a per unit basis as complexes with more units. Smaller units also had fewer problems with contamination in their recyclables.

Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15–37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be ‘committed to extinction’. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (∼18%) than mid-range (∼24%) and maximum-change (∼35%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.","We thank the following for many contributions: E.

Students in two psychology classes were divided by class into two groups. The experimental group was offered various combinations of prizes such as cash, a tour of a mental-health facility, car servicing, and a university parking sticker for reducing driving. The value of the prize received was scaled in terms of per cent reduction in driving. The contrast group received no inducements. The condition in which the experimental group's mileage reduction was reinforced was counterbalanced by two baseline conditions. Several special recording procedures were used to reduce and detect the possibility of subjects altering their odometers, the source of the driving data. Experimental subjects reduced their average daily mileage by 20% relative to the initial baseline; the contrast group did not change. During the one-month reinforcement condition, the 12 experimental subjects saved some 170 gallons (worth $102) of gasoline.",,Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis,10,1,46,,"['pub.1002820121', 'pub.1041250181', 'pub.1026460447']",Behavior Analysis and Environmental Protection: Accomplishments and Potential for More

Participants (with the exception of the control group) received feedback in various forms, i.e. consumption compared to previous consumption or to similar others; energy saving tips in leaflets or on a computer; or feedback relating to financial or environmental costs. Respondents were interviewed after the start of the study to establish their income, socio-demographic status, environmental attitudes and the extent to which they already engaged in conserving activities. Participants also took part in focus groups after the final meter readings were taken. Overall the results indicated that income and demographic features predicted historic energy consumption but not changes in consumption during the field study, where environmental attitudes and feedback were influential. Of all the feedback groups, the installation of computers helped reduce consumption most markedly. Furthermore, people with positive environmental attitudes, but who had not previously been engaged in many conservation actions, were more likely to change their consumption subsequent to the feedback period.

In the “fear plus greed” paradigm, each of the players receives a monetary endowment and then may choose independently and anonymously whether to contribute it to a monetary public good. The good is supplied to all n players if m or more players contribute (1 < m < n − 1). In the “no fear” paradigm, the opportunity to free ride is maintained, but a protection from having one's contribution wasted is provided, whereas in the “no greed” paradigm it is possible to waste one's contribution, but not to free ride. Decision policies maximizing expected utility are derived for all three paradigms under a homogeneity assumption postulating that a player expects each of the other n − 1 group members to contribute with a fixed probability p and a heterogeneity assumption asserting that the n − 1 p s are independently sampled from a subjective probability distribution over the interval [0, 1].

Budescu, Amnon Rapoport",Springer Nature,2001-05,10.1023/a:1011205901283,pub.1009109811,"Common to most theoretical and empirical research on public goods is the assumption that the parameters of the game are common knowledge. Recent theoretical and empirical studies have questioned this assumption by arguing that many public goods situations are characterized by uncertainty regarding various aspects of the situation. In particular, Suleiman (1997) argued that members of production groups of step-level public goods are often uncertain about the value of the provision threshold. For this type of uncertainty he proposed three distinct models to account for the individual's contribution.The present study reports the results of an experiment designed primarily to test and contrast the predictions derived from two of these models – a subjective expected utility model and a cooperative model – regarding the effects of threshold uncertainty on contribution for the provision of step-level public goods. Other goals of the study were to test the joint effect of the threshold uncertainty level, and its mean (low vs. high), on contribution, and to examine the effect of threshold uncertainty on the individuals' estimates regarding the contributions of other group members.The results show that the effect of threshold uncertainty is moderated by the threshold mean: Contribution to the public good increased as a function of uncertainty for the lower threshold mean, and decreased (though not significantly) for the higher threshold mean. In contrast, for the two threshold means the subjects' estimates of the mean and variability of others' contribution increased with threshold uncertainty.The models' comparison revealed that the cooperative model was superior to the subjective expected utility model. This result adds to a substantial body of research on social dilemmas showing that under conditions of social (strategic) uncertainty, group members tacitly coordinate their choice behavior by anchoring their decisions on rules of fairness.",,Group Decision and Negotiation,10,3,25,,"['pub.1004304105', 'pub.1013955276', 'pub.1024092571', 'pub.1031873810', 'pub.1033196019', 'pub.1021010490', 'pub.1041620738', 'pub.1047278741', 'pub.1029749661', 'pub.1028556807', 'pub.1027042951', 'pub.1042723142', 'pub.1002773156', 'pub.1034582388', 'pub.1005550954', 'pub.1053479307', 'pub.1069989874', 'pub.1001062742', 'pub.1063626359', 'pub.1034681505', 'pub.1052198485', 'pub.1000943781', 'pub.1026897379', 'pub.1052347650', 'pub.1003582860', 'pub.1042595885', 'pub.1054081587', 'pub.1053765304', 'pub.1009184830', 'pub.1032406895', 'pub.1033036737', 'pub.1033808907', 'pub.1037160195', 'pub.1021312588']",Conflict and Coordination in the Provision of Public Goods: A Conceptual Analysis of Continuous and Step-Level Games

We found a significant ""position effect"" in all three nonsimultaneous protocols: Mean individual requests and position in the sequence are negatively correlated, reflecting an ""early mover advantage"" and a ""late mover handicap."" The effect is weakest in the positional protocol, whereas the sequential and cumulative protocols are, practically, identical. We conclude that although position effects can be induced by temporal priority, they are primarily driven by differential patterns of information regarding the behavior of the other group members. Although the request pattern was consistent with predictions based on the subjects' social orientation, the differences were not quite as pronounced (and significant) as in the ""regular"" simultaneous dilemmas.

Previous research has shown that strengthening group identity promotes cooperation. One explanation for this finding is that a strong group identity transforms people's motives from the personal to the collective level (the goal transformation hypothesis). Evidence for this hypothesis can be found in studies showing that a strong sense of group identity influences proselfs, relative to prosocials, to make larger contributions. In this experiment, we demonstrated that these findings are restricted to situations in which no feedback about a group's performance is provided. When performance feedback is provided, a strong group identity cancels the effects of individual differences in social value orientations. In particular, when a group fails, contributions increase if group identity is salient, but decrease if personal identity is salient, regardless of a person's social value orientation. But when a group succeeds, no differences between group and personal identity are found. These results are discussed in terms of the goal transformation hypothesis.","This research was supported by a fellowship of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NOW, Grant No. 016.005.019) awarded to the first author.

Two explanations are plausible: Discussion may (a) enhance feelings of group identity or (b) induce commitments to cooperate. Some remedies for social dilemmas (like group communication) may be subclassified as public-welfare remedies (of which enhanced group identity is an example) versus cooperation-contingent remedies (of which commitment is an example). The efficacy of a cooperative act for enhancing the collective welfare should moderate remedies of the former but not the latter type.

To advance a theory of decision making in social dilemmas, this article provides a conceptual review of the literature that applies a ""logic of appropriateness"" (March, 1994) framework. The appropriateness framework suggests that people making decisions ask themselves (explicitly or implicitly), ""What does a person like me do in a situation like this? "" This question identifies 3 significant factors: recognition and classification of the kind of situation encountered, the identity of the individual making the decision, and the application of rules or heuristics in guiding behavioral choice. In contrast with dominant rational choice models, the appropriateness framework proposed accommodates the inherently social nature of social dilemmas, and the role of rule and heuristic based processing.

Communication among the members of a group has been shown to enhance cooperation (maximize groups interests); it was hypothesized that if members are allowed to make a pledge prior to their actual decision, they can communicate their intentions and hence increase the cooperation rate. Two experiments were conducted in which several types of pledge conditions were contrasted with a ""no-pledge"" (control) condition. As hypothesized, the results indicate that a pledge enhanced cooperation. However, the degree of commitment required in the pledge differentially affected the cooperation rate. The results are interpreted in terms of a two-stage dilemma in which members can coordinate their expectations only if some degree of commitment is required in their pledge.",,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,60,3,60,,,Conflict and Coordination in the Provision of Public Goods: A Conceptual Analysis of Continuous and Step-Level Games

In 3 experimental studies, the authors investigated the extent to which a common understanding about task and behavioral requirements is essential for the tacit coordination process. The results show that people are less likely to coordinate on the equal division rule when collective feedback on past performance (Study 1), the distribution of information within the group (Study 2), or expected behavioral variance (Study 3) suggests that a common understanding in the group is lacking. Moreover, the results indicate that under these conditions, rather than adhering to the equal division rule, people base their decisions on their own social value orientations.

However, experiments show that people will punish free riders, even at considerable cost. To examine the implications of agents who punish, we simulate an environment populated with behavioral strategies seen in the lab and use the simulation to develop hypotheses about why group size should matter when punishment is allowed. We test these hypotheses experimentally and examine whether the effect of group size is purely due to the number of group members or if information about other group members is what is important. We find that large groups contribute at rates no lower than small groups because punishment does not fall appreciably in large groups.

As members of a four-person group, subjects either played a one-trial Public Good Dilemma or a one-trial Resource Dilemma. In the Public Good Dilemma, members learned that they were endowed with a certain number of points and that they could obtain a bonus if as a group they could take more than 120 points. In the Resource Dilemma, members learned that they could take points from a certain source and that they could obtain a bonus if they would leave more than 120 points in this source. In experiments 1 and 2, asymmetry of endowments was induced: In the Public Good Dilemma, two members could give twice as many points as the other two, whereas in the Resource Dilemma, two members could take twice as many points as the other two. In experiment 3, asymmetry of interests was induced: All members could give/take an equal number of points, but two members would receive 33% of the bonus whereas the other two would receive 17%. The results of these experiments show that group members tend to coordinate their choice behavior differently in these two dilemma situations. Members playing a Public Good Dilemma tend to give in proportion to their endowments or interest position.

Four experiments were performed to explore this question. In Experiment 1 it was demonstrated that group members correctly perceive that self-efficacy declines with group size for step-level public goods problems. In Experiments 2 and 3, group size was objectively unrelated to the subjects' impact on the group's chances for obtaining a public good. But in both experiments, subjects still felt more self-efficacious when the group was smaller. A final experiment explored the relationship between group size and perceived collective efficacy for obtaining a public good. When the provision point was relatively low (viz., one-third of the group had to contribute to provide the public good), subjects generally perceived smaller groups to be more efficacious than larger groups, even though under certain conditions precisely the opposite was true. These illusions of efficacy were attributed to familiar judgmental heuristics, involving an overgeneralization of experience in groups of varying sizes.

The studies indicate that consistent contributors occur naturally, and their presence in a group causes others to contribute more and cooperate more often, with no apparent cost to the consistent contributor and often gain. These positive effects seem to result from a consistent contributor's impact on group members' cooperative inferences about group norms.",,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,95,6,76,"['Adult', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Identification']","['pub.1069908724', 'pub.1019238347', 'pub.1064531158', 'pub.1014031821', 'pub.1040529180', 'pub.1069757815', 'pub.1031873810', 'pub.1036284779', 'pub.1003444238', 'pub.1064222221', 'pub.1058548165', 'pub.1058697806', 'pub.1070972833', 'pub.1063625933', 'pub.1036486759', 'pub.1049120330', 'pub.1062529991', 'pub.1127642305', 'pub.1049584803', 'pub.1040289767', 'pub.1023333324', 'pub.1037103353', 'pub.1063626363', 'pub.1019680597', 'pub.1058602752', 'pub.1031251345', 'pub.1005874029', 'pub.1053410966', 'pub.1050711283', 'pub.1045342967', 'pub.1010694394', 'pub.1069908142', 'pub.1026656856', 'pub.1053800828', 'pub.1002501103', 'pub.1046945324', 'pub.1063626339', 'pub.1062452064', 'pub.1026004121', 'pub.1026115854', 'pub.1069908660', 'pub.1050152626', 'pub.1013458447', 'pub.1003894630', 'pub.1058546994', 'pub.1037493457', 'pub.1020622896', 'pub.1081028532', 'pub.1070069775', 'pub.1043872666', 'pub.1025122948', 'pub.1038155293', 'pub.1021451974', 'pub.1072899156', 'pub.1072896085']",Conflict and Coordination in the Provision of Public Goods: A Conceptual Analysis of Continuous and Step-Level Games

Two group motivation loss effects demonstrated in previous research, the social-loafing effect and the free-rider effect, are shown to follow from social dilemma theories. An experiment with 75 undergraduates was performed to empirically demonstrate a 3rd motivation loss effect, termed the ""sucker"" effect. It was hypothesized that group members would reduce their efforts if they had a capable partner who free-rode on their efforts, that is, who was capable of contributing to the group but would not. This prediction was confirmed. The effect was particularly strong in males. Potential remedies for such motivation losses are discussed.

One hundred and ten business students participated in a computerized laboratory experiment in which four conditions were created: the same one (or two) members defect over all trials—a fixed pattern, or a different one (or two) members defect on different trials—a diffused pattern. Results show that the effects of social orientation and defection size were initially significant but diminished over trials. In contrast, the effects of defection pattern became increasingly significant over trials. Specifically, we found that members’ tolerance level was significantly higher in conditions where a diffused rather than a fixed pattern of defection was observed.

80,Why prosocials exhibit greater cooperation than proselfs: the roles of social responsibility and reciprocity,"David De Cremer, Paul A. M. Van Lange",SAGE Publications,2001-11,10.1002/per.418,pub.1003749494,"Two studies examined the choice differences between prosocials and proselfs by examining the influence of norms of social responsibility and reciprocity. In line with the integrative model of social value orientation, it was expected that prosocials differ from proselfs in their level of cooperation because they wish to maximize own and other's outcomes (i.e. paralleling the norm of social responsibility) and enhance equality in outcomes (i.e. paralleling the norm of reciprocity). Study 1 revealed that prosocials felt more responsible to further the group's interest than proselfs did and this social responsibility feeling appeared to account for choice differences. Study 2 revealed that prosocials were more likely to reciprocate their partner's actions than were proselfs. Also, feelings of social responsibility did not account for this observation, suggesting that enhancing joint outcomes and equality in outcomes constitute two relatively independent dimensions. The findings are discussed in light of the integrative model of social value orientation.

In Experiment 2, we manipulated expectations experimentally. Participants who moved simultaneously reciprocated what they expected their partners to do. Participants who moved pseudo-sequentially defected, regardless of what they expected from their opponents.

In two studies, we examined the motives that may underlie the use of the equality rule. More specifically, we examined whether people use the equality rule out of fairness concerns or out of efficiency concerns. For this purpose, we assessed people's emotional reactions toward a violator of the equality rule when the group succeeded vs. failed, as a function of social value orientation. The results of both experiments showed that proselfs' emotional reactions towards a violator were a function of the success or the failure of the group, whereas prosocials' emotional reactions did not vary as a function of the outcome feedback. These results suggest that prosocials prefer the equality rule out of fairness concerns whereas for proselfs efficiency concerns dominate.

On the basis of charismatic leadership theories, it was expected that a charismatic leader would be able to transform people's motives beyond self-interest, consequently increasing cooperation. This transformation effect was expected to occur among individuals aimed at maximizing their own self-interest (i.e., pro-selfs), but not among those aimed at maximizing joint or collective outcomes (i.e., pro-socials). Furthermore, leader's charisma was experimentally manipulated by means of describing the leader as either self-sacrificing or benefiting. The results revealed that self-sacrificing leaders, contrary to benefiting leaders, were perceived as more charismatic and were able to motivate decision-makers to cooperate more. The latter effect appeared to be more pronounced among pro-selfs rather than pro-socials, as such supporting the transformational idea of charismatic leaders. Further results showed that this behavioral effect was mediated by perceptions of legitimacy.

88,Divergent evidence on free riding: An experimental examination of possible explanations,"R. Mark Isaac, James M. Walker, Susan H. Thomas",Springer Nature,1984-01,10.1007/bf00140829,pub.1013143800,"Summary, conclusions and extensionsThe most important single observation from this research is the similarity between our wide range of results and the multitude of seemingly divergent conclusions about free riding from previous experimental results. Even when defined in the restrictive manner of this paper, free riding is neither absolutely all pervasive nor always nonexistent. This ‘intermediate’ result is not the same as a general theory which states that the predictable result of public goods provision processes is always weak free riding. The extremes of strong free riding and near-Lindahl optimal behavior can and do occur.These experiments further demonstrate that this diversity of outcome need not be attributed to inexplicable randomness. At least for the case of the voluntary contribution mechanism, there are identifiable factors which make free riding more or less likely to occur. Two such factors have been identified here: (i) the replication environment and (ii) per capita marginal return. This latter parameter can be related to although it is not equivalent to group size.This research is not intended to ‘model’ a precise quantitative prediction about free riding. Having identified, in a general manner, these effects, the groundwork is set for many interesting questions in future research:Although the qualitative results more often suggest that ‘free riding’ behavior increases with experience, there are no statistically supported conclusions. A design focusing on the factor of experience could reveal whether this effect is sustained under more extensive replication.The influence of marginal per capita return is striking. Why is there a difference when zero contribution is a single period dominant strategy for either level (.3 or .75)? How extensive is the interaction of replication and marginal per capita return? We are currently conducting a new set of experiments focusing upon these issues.Given the power of the marginal per capita return, what happens in situations in which this parameter varies, as in a quadratic return function?Why did some individuals contribute positive amounts even in the 10th period when the learning and multiperiod gaming aspects were presumably of minimal effect? We conjecture that this represents a core of people for whom utility functions are not completely selfish or who otherwise wish to believe in ‘good guy’ fashion. However, it is possible that some individuals were still learning their single period dominant strategy or did not correctly notice the presence of a truly single period decision environment. In any case, it appears that marginal per capita return again plays a role.With the group production technology held constant, increasing group size (with a concomitant decrease in marginal per capita return) has the expected effect of increasing ‘free riding’ type behavior. Standardizing for marginal per capita return, the effect of group size becomes ambiguous, and shows evidence of reversing. This aspect of group size effects is another area for future research. Our ongoing research will also look at this question.What can be said about economies which lack condition D*? If individuals have no dominant strategy, the very concept of ‘free riding’ becomes poorly defined. Definitions and predictions must explicitly state what assumptions about expectations and what solution concepts are being employed.In summary, we find that there is no successful general theory which states that all individuals always free ride a lot, always free ride a little, or never free ride. Under the appropriate circumstances, we find people who will do any or all of the above. This research gives some guidelines as to why and when free riding can be expected. Further work in both theory and experiments may be able to tell even more.",,Public Choice,43,2,379,,"['pub.1069623433', 'pub.1058546435', 'pub.1015895530', 'pub.1058546592', 'pub.1035867917', 'pub.1002026222']",Conflict and Coordination in the Provision of Public Goods: A Conceptual Analysis of Continuous and Step-Level Games

The second part is an extended treatment of possible solutions for social dilemmas. These solutions are organized into three broad categories based on whether the solutions assume egoistic actors and whether the structure of the situation can be changed: Motivational solutions assume actors are not completely egoistic and so give some weight to the outcomes of their partners. Strategic solutions assume egoistic actors, and neither of these categories of solutions involve changing the fundamental structure of the situation.

We hypothesised that social identification effects could be either ascribed to (1) an increase in the value assigned to the collective good (i.e. goal-transformation hypothesis) or (2) an enhancement of trust in the cooperation of other group members (i.e. goal-amplification hypothesis). To disentangle these two explanations, we examined the effects of social identification on the contributions to a public good of people with a different social value orientation (i.e. pre-existing differences in preferred outcome distribution between self and others). Following the goal transformation hypothesis, we predicted that an increased group identification would raise contributions, in particular for people essentially concerned with their personal welfare (i.e. pro-self value orientation). Alternatively, following the goal amplification hypothesis it was expected that increased group identification would primarily affect decisions of people concerned with the collective welfare (i.e. prosocial value orientation). The results of all three studies provided support for the goal-transformation rather than goal-amplification hypothesis, suggesting that ‘selfish’ individuals can be encouraged to cooperate by increasing the salience of their group membership.

We argue that under resource size certainty people anchor their decisions on tacit coordination rules such as the equal division rule, whereas under resource size uncertainty people rely more on their own social value orientations to determine their choice behavior. The results corroborate our line of reasoning. When the size of the resource was certain, proselfs as well as prosocials anchored their decisions on the equal division rule. Under resource size uncertainty, the equal division rule appeared to lose its coordinating potential, inducing proselfs to harvest more than prosocials.",,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,42,4,63,,"['pub.1050617223', 'pub.1012713213', 'pub.1014031821', 'pub.1014367999', 'pub.1033196019', 'pub.1021010490', 'pub.1019590876', 'pub.1027042951', 'pub.1044130908', 'pub.1042723142', 'pub.1002773156', 'pub.1034582388', 'pub.1006674865', 'pub.1005550954', 'pub.1003749494', 'pub.1001062742', 'pub.1004915033', 'pub.1046488803', 'pub.1016922459', 'pub.1042653274', 'pub.1049963917', 'pub.1046737384', 'pub.1011343128', 'pub.1050152626', 'pub.1017267841', 'pub.1026897379', 'pub.1049051451', 'pub.1032406895', 'pub.1025293489', 'pub.1001766994', 'pub.1013702671', 'pub.1033808907']",Conflict and Coordination in the Provision of Public Goods: A Conceptual Analysis of Continuous and Step-Level Games

To study the free-rider problem and its effects on conflict resolution, (a) intergroup conflicts are modeled as team games; (b) a new team game that models intergroup conflicts over continuous public goods is introduced and is contrasted with a recently developed game that simulates intergroup conflicts over step-level public goods; and (c) 2 experiments that compared the effects of communication in the 2 team games are reported. Experiment I shows that within-group discussion is highly effective in solving the intragroup dilemma in the step-level game but much less effective in the continuous game.

We study a new information structure - called the positional order protocol - under which requests are made in an exogenously determined and commonly known order without disclosing the requests of previous players in the sequence. Mean individual requests under this protocol of play are compared with data gathered under the more familiar simultaneous protocol (simultaneously made requests) and sequential protocol (sequentially made requests with full disclosure of previous requests). Previously reported effects of the resource uncertainty on individual requests obtained under the simultaneous and sequential protocols are generalized across different group sizes. In contrast to the game-theoretical prediction, which does not distinguish between the simultaneous and positional order protocols, mean individual requests and position in the sequence are highly and significantly correlated.

In Experiment 1 conducted in Groningen (the Netherlands), it was found that people with pro-social orientations expected more cooperation from another described as intelligent than from another described as unintelligent, whereas individualists and competitors expected relatively more cooperation from another described as unintelligent. The cross-cultural generalizability of this finding was examined and supported in Experiment 2 which was conducted in Santa Barbara (U.S.A.). Results from both studies are consistent with the Goal Prescribes Rationality Principle (Van Lange, Liebrand and Kuhlman, 1990) which assumes that people with pro-social (cooperative) orientations would perceive rationality in social dilemmas primarily from the collective perspective, whereas individualists and competitors would take a strong egocentric perspective on rationality. In addition, we found a strong relationship between expectations of other's cooperation and own cooperative behaviour when the other was described as intelligent.

                    This article reports small group experiments in which subjects may choose to contribute a fixed amount of money toward a monetary public good, and in which the good itself is supplied only if a specified number of contributions (or more) are made. Given the opportunity to communicate, our subjects organized themselves by specifying precisely the number of required contributors and who they would be. This organization, which we call designation of a
                    minimal contributing set,
                    always resulted in provision of the public good, and provision in a nearly optimal manner. In contrast, groups presented with the identical problem but not allowed to communicate failed to generate a sufficient number of contributions 35 percent of the time, and in slightly over half of the successful groups, overprovision produced inefficiency.
                  
                  
                    We present hypotheses about why designating a minimal contributing set works, and data indicating that the mechanism results in reduced normative conflict and felt risk, as well as increased efficiency. The essential property of the minimal contributing set, we hypothesize, is
                    criticalness:
                    the contributions of the members of the minimal contributing set are each critical to obtaining the public good the members desire, and they know it. It is reasonable (albeit not a dominant strategy) to contribute because reasonable behavior can be expected from other minimal contributing set members who are in the same situation. Unreasonableness is a problem that increases with the size of groups, but adaptations exist that, we argue, can reduce its seriousness.
