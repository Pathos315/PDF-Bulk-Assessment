0,Association of occupational burnout and occupational exposure factors on psychological health among factory workers and miners: a propensity score analysis,"Yaoqin Lu, Zhe Zhang, Sunyujie Gao, Huan Yan, Lijiang Zhang, Jiwen Liu",Springer Nature,2020-10-27,10.1007/s00420-020-01587-6,pub.1132052677,"PurposeThis study is to explore the association of occupational burnout and occupational exposure factors on psychological health among factory workers and miners.MethodsA total of 6130 factories workers and miners in Urumqi, China were included using a cluster sampling method. The occupational burnout and psychological health were investigates using the Chinese Maslach Burnout Inventory (CMBI) and the Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90). The propensity score analysis (PSA) was used to eliminate the influence of individual characteristics, and 2164 pairs of participants on psychological healthy and unhealthy were matched. After PSA, the relationship between occupational burnout, occupational hazard exposure, and psychological health was evaluated.ResultsThe results showed that asbestos dust (OR 1.65, CI 95% 1.35–2.02) and CMBI (OR 2.59, CI 95% 2.39–2.83) were risk factors affecting psychological health (P < 0.001).ConclusionsMeasures need to be taken to ease occupational burnout among factories workers and miners, and strengthen personal protection to improve their psychological health.",,International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health,94,3,0,"['Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational', 'Asbestos', 'Burnout, Professional', 'China', 'Dust', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Manufacturing Industry', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Miners', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupational Health', 'Propensity Score', 'Risk Factors']","['pub.1103282306', 'pub.1008989522', 'pub.1128794123', 'pub.1016796903', 'pub.1059948400', 'pub.1022248795', 'pub.1125103676', 'pub.1084005577', 'pub.1020194314', 'pub.1034306397', 'pub.1117157157', 'pub.1058305727', 'pub.1120025449', 'pub.1129991506', 'pub.1128091744', 'pub.1026060254', 'pub.1004796036', 'pub.1084250686', 'pub.1001311348', 'pub.1084500264', 'pub.1023410159', 'pub.1044893161', 'pub.1111659650', 'pub.1017019130', 'pub.1006767602', 'pub.1064002496', 'pub.1070773408', 'pub.1043425172', 'pub.1028914324', 'pub.1046865341', 'pub.1049768038', 'pub.1027584099', 'pub.1016576997', 'pub.1100426194', 'pub.1112520723', 'pub.1013301058', 'pub.1022230928']"

3,"Toward the bigger picture: Concrete and abstract thinking about a transgression, and the role of time in interpersonal forgiveness","Michael Wenzel, Anne‐Marie Coughlin",Wiley,2020-05-29,10.1002/ejsp.2676,pub.1126882543,"Rumination is commonly considered detrimental to forgiveness. In contrast, we propose that different forms of post‐transgression thinking are differentially effective for forgiveness, depending on their timing. Concrete thinking focuses on event details, whereas abstract thinking abstracts from details and views the event in a broader context. Following construal level theory, we propose that concrete thinking is increasingly ill‐matched, and abstract thinking better matched, to the construal abilities and motivation afforded by psychological distance. Hence, over time, concrete thinking would be negatively, and abstract thinking positively, associated with forgiveness. Two correlational recall studies, with time since transgression measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2), demonstrated that with greater temporal distance concrete thinking was more negatively, and abstract thinking more positively, related to forgiveness. Study 3 employed a prospective‐longitudinal methodology over five time‐points; intra‐individual decrease in concrete thinking and increase in abstract thinking over time were related to higher levels of forgiveness.",,European Journal of Social Psychology,50,4,4,,"['pub.1048824766', 'pub.1035188535', 'pub.1061949331', 'pub.1056347339', 'pub.1042159964', 'pub.1051805261', 'pub.1071708260', 'pub.1007521565', 'pub.1010135857', 'pub.1061834261', 'pub.1036694070', 'pub.1020448260', 'pub.1007333205', 'pub.1073308954', 'pub.1067636187', 'pub.1046307669', 'pub.1069388153', 'pub.1063740047', 'pub.1008873248', 'pub.1038245196', 'pub.1036668785', 'pub.1033853075', 'pub.1063740387', 'pub.1021557563', 'pub.1024585622', 'pub.1010713539', 'pub.1047773560', 'pub.1021226817', 'pub.1061949328', 'pub.1054045772', 'pub.1039836349', 'pub.1063740273', 'pub.1123237602', 'pub.1030236095', 'pub.1005132480', 'pub.1007138869', 'pub.1058803290', 'pub.1029654112', 'pub.1033991006', 'pub.1027426061', 'pub.1004250680', 'pub.1017310132']"
4,Modeling the spread of fake news on Twitter,"Taichi Murayama, Shoko Wakamiya, Eiji Aramaki, Ryota Kobayashi",Public Library of Science (PLoS),2021-04-22,10.1371/journal.pone.0250419,pub.1137403018,"Fake news can have a significant negative impact on society because of the growing use of mobile devices and the worldwide increase in Internet access. It is therefore essential to develop a simple mathematical model to understand the online dissemination of fake news. In this study, we propose a point process model of the spread of fake news on Twitter. The proposed model describes the spread of a fake news item as a two-stage process: initially, fake news spreads as a piece of ordinary news; then, when most users start recognizing the falsity of the news item, that itself spreads as another news story. We validate this model using two datasets of fake news items spread on Twitter. We show that the proposed model is superior to the current state-of-the-art methods in accurately predicting the evolution of the spread of a fake news item. Moreover, a text analysis suggests that our model appropriately infers the correction time, i.e., the moment when Twitter users start realizing the falsity of the news item. The proposed model contributes to understanding the dynamics of the spread of fake news on social media. Its ability to extract a compact representation of the spreading pattern could be useful in the detection and mitigation of fake news.","This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19K20279 to S.W., 331 JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19H04221 and Health and Labor Sciences Research 332 Grant Number H30-shinkougyousei-shitei-004 to S.W. and E.A., and JSPS KAKENHI 333 Grant Numbers JP17H03279, JP18K11560, and JP19H01133, and JST PRESTO Grant 334 Numbers JPMJPR1925 to R.K.

6,THE IMS PARADOX: A PERSPECTIVE ON STRUCTURAL ION MOBILITY‐MASS SPECTROMETRY,"Jacob W. McCabe, Michael J. Hebert, Mehdi Shirzadeh, Christopher S. Mallis, Joanna K. Denton, Thomas E. Walker, David H. Russell",Wiley,2020-07,10.1002/mas.21642,pub.1128880427,"Studies of large proteins, protein complexes, and membrane protein complexes pose new challenges, most notably the need for increased ion mobility (IM) and mass spectrometry (MS) resolution. This review covers evolutionary developments in IM-MS in the authors' and key collaborators' laboratories with specific focus on developments that enhance the utility of IM-MS for structural analysis. IM-MS measurements are performed on gas phase ions, thus ""structural IM-MS"" appears paradoxical-do gas phase ions retain their solution phase structure? There is growing evidence to support the notion that solution phase structure(s) can be retained by the gas phase ions. It should not go unnoticed that we use ""structures"" in this statement because an important feature of IM-MS is the ability to deal with conformationally heterogeneous systems, thus providing a direct measure of conformational entropy. The extension of this work to large proteins and protein complexes has motivated our development of Fourier-transform IM-MS instruments, a strategy first described by Hill and coworkers in 1985 (Anal Chem, 1985, 57, pp. 402-406) that has proved to be a game-changer in our quest to merge drift tube (DT) and ion mobility and the high mass resolution orbitrap MS instruments. DT-IMS is the only method that allows first-principles determinations of rotationally averaged collision cross sections (CSS), which is essential for studies of biomolecules where the conformational diversities of the molecule precludes the use of CCS calibration approaches. The Fourier transform-IM-orbitrap instrument described here also incorporates the full suite of native MS/IM-MS capabilities that are currently employed in the most advanced native MS/IM-MS instruments. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

However, this is often poorly managed for people living with dementia.
AIM: To explore nurses' experiences of pain management in end-of-life dementia care.
METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic narrative review of research papers published in English between 2008 and 2018 was conducted. Data sources were CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect and SocIndex. Articles focused on nursing at the end of life and pain management in people with dementia.
FINDINGS: Eight articles were retrieved that met the search criteria. Four studies used qualitative methodology, two quantitative and two mixed methods. Studies from the UK dominated (<i>n</i>=5), the remainder were from Sweden, Norway and the US. Following thematic analysis, three themes were identified: training and education in pain management at the end of life for people with dementia, challenges in identifying pain and pain assessment tool use.
CONCLUSION: The review revealed inadequate education for nurses concerning end-of-life care for people living with dementia, notably concerning pain recognition and use of assessment tools.

9,COVID-19 Vaccine Passports: Human Rights and the Need for Pro-Ethical Design,"Emmie Hine, Jessica Morley, Mariarosaria Taddeo, Luciano Floridi",Elsevier,2021,10.2139/ssrn.3885252,pub.1139673798,"Since the first case was reported to the World Health Organisation in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has caused social and economic devastation on a scale not seen since World War 2. As the milestone of 2 years of ‘living with the virus’ approaches, Governments and businesses are desperate to develop interventions that can facilitate the reopening of society whilst still protecting public health. As the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations has gathered pace worldwide, particularly in wealthier countries, those responsible for developing such interventions have begun to focus on the use of digital ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Passports’, which can be used to prove that an individual has had an approved COVID-19 vaccination (both doses where applicable). Governments hope that Vaccine Passports may be used to facilitate international travel and permit increased domestic liberties, for example allowing people to access public venues, to attend large gatherings, or to return to work without compromising personal safety and public health. “Yellow Fever certificates”, required to enter a specific list of countries maintained by the World Health Organisation, provide a precedent for this type of intervention. However, there are concerns that the use of COVID-19 Vaccine Passports could be viewed as a mechanism for introducing a mandatory vaccination policy, and there are also concerns that due to issues related to the unequal global distribution of effective vaccines and ‘the digital divide’ their use could exacerbate inequalities. Therefore, we set out to answer the following questions: a) how should businesses and Governments assess the risks challenging human rights, public health, and digital ethics, which emerge from developing and deploying COVID-19 Vaccine Passports; b) do the implications for human rights, public health, and data ethics vary depending on where and when COVID-19 Vaccine Passports are used; c) what design decisions should businesses make when developing COVID-19 Vaccine Passports to help ensure they respect human rights, and both public health and data ethics; d) what are the rights and powers of the individual to object to, or seek remedy for, the use of COVID-19 Vaccine Passports; and e) how can the risks of inequalities and social division derived from the use of COVID-19 Vaccine Passports be avoided or mitigated?Here we discuss our findings based on a systematised literature review and documentary analysis. We find that in the context of a global public health emergency, COVID-19 status passes are ethically and legally permissible under relevant human rights and international health regulations, provided they are designed, implemented, and used in accordance with the least infringement principle and the value of equality. We then set out 17 concrete recommendations for supranational bodies, national governments, and businesses to help ensure they develop and deploy COVID-19 Vaccine Passports accordingly.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,0,,"['pub.1135910081', 'pub.1136339825', 'pub.1137369913', 'pub.1033385884', 'pub.1011935974', 'pub.1136853442', 'pub.1135646426', 'pub.1125499013', 'pub.1136999079', 'pub.1040655957', 'pub.1138071071', 'pub.1129077168', 'pub.1137229804', 'pub.1000750002', 'pub.1135909874', 'pub.1137256211', 'pub.1127409048', 'pub.1130019675', 'pub.1005525522', 'pub.1062819669', 'pub.1135782913', 'pub.1127989603', 'pub.1068843655']"
10,Attention and Working Memory Biases to Black and Asian Faces During Intergroup Contexts,"Guadalupe D. S. Gonzalez, David M. Schnyer",Frontiers,2019-01-09,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02743,pub.1111256514,"Categorizing and individual as a racial ingroup or outgroup member results in processing and memory differences. However, despite processing differences for racial ingroups and outgroups, very little is known about processing of racial ingroup and outgroup members during intergroup contexts. Thus, the present research investigated attention and memory differences for racial ingroup and outgroup members during competition for attention (i.e., intergroup contexts). In experiment 1, event-related potentials (ERPs) were obtained while participants completed a working memory task that presented 4 faces (2 Black, 2 White) at once then, following a short delay, were probed to indicate the spatial location of one of the faces. Participants showed better location memory for Black than White faces. During encoding, ERP results revealed differences based on the race of the face in P300 amplitudes, such that there was greater motivated processing when attending to Black faces. At probe, the N170 indicated enhanced early processing of Black faces and greater LPCs were associated with better recollection of Black face location. In a follow-up study using the same task, we examined attention and working memory biases for Asian and White faces in Caucasian and Asian participants. Results for both Caucasian and Asian participants indicated better working memory for Asian relative to White faces. Together, results indicate that during intergroup contexts, racial minority faces capture attention, resulting in better memory for those faces. The study underscores that examining racial biases with single stimuli paradigms obscures important aspects of attention and memory biases during intergroup contexts.","We thank Bianca Chavez, Marissa Hansen, Fariya Sahadat, Jiazhou Chen, Italia Lopez-Valenzuela, Annmarie Calderon, and Allie Vasak for assistance in data collection, and Drs.

11,Shared neural underpinnings of multisensory integration and trial-by-trial perceptual recalibration in humans,"Hame Park, Christoph Kayser",eLife,2019-06-27,10.7554/elife.47001,pub.1117510260,"Perception adapts to mismatching multisensory information, both when different cues appear simultaneously and when they appear sequentially. While both multisensory integration and adaptive trial-by-trial recalibration are central for behavior, it remains unknown whether they are mechanistically linked and arise from a common neural substrate. To relate the neural underpinnings of sensory integration and recalibration, we measured whole-brain magnetoencephalography while human participants performed an audio-visual ventriloquist task. Using single-trial multivariate analysis, we localized the perceptually-relevant encoding of multisensory information within and between trials. While we found neural signatures of multisensory integration within temporal and parietal regions, only medial superior parietal activity encoded past and current sensory information and mediated the perceptual recalibration within and between trials. These results highlight a common neural substrate of sensory integration and perceptual recalibration, and reveal a role of medial parietal regions in linking present and previous multisensory evidence to guide adaptive behavior.","The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

12,Moral responses to the COVID-19 crisis,"Joaquin Navajas, Facundo Álvarez Heduan, Gerry Garbulsky, Enzo Tagliazucchi, Dan Ariely, Mariano Sigman",The Royal Society,2021-09-14,10.1098/rsos.210096,pub.1141106503,"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised complex moral dilemmas that have been the subject of extensive public debate. Here, we study how people judge a set of controversial actions related to the crisis: relaxing data privacy standards to allow public control of the pandemic, forbidding public gatherings, denouncing a friend who violated COVID-19 protocols, prioritizing younger over older patients when medical resources are scarce, and reducing animal rights to accelerate vaccine development. We collected acceptability judgements in an initial large-scale study with participants from 10 Latin American countries (<i>N</i> = 15 420). A formal analysis of the intrinsic correlations between responses to different dilemmas revealed that judgements were organized in two dimensions: one that reflects a focus on human life expectancy and one that cares about the health of all sentient lives in an equitable manner. These stereotyped patterns of responses were stronger in people who endorsed utilitarian decisions in a standardized scale. A second pre-registered study performed in the USA (<i>N</i> = 1300) confirmed the replicability of these findings. Finally, we show how the prioritization of public health correlated with several contextual, personality and demographic factors. Overall, this research sheds light on the relationship between utilitarian decision-making and moral responses to the COVID-19 crisis.","We thank Victoria Milano, Rocco Di Tella, Juan Ignacio Cuile, Maria Agustina Nahas, Laura Gonzalez, Juan Manuel Garrido, Pablo Gonzalez, Nuria Caceres, Marco Sartorio and Lucia Freira for assistance with data collection.",Royal Society Open Science,8,9,1,,"['pub.1032821519', 'pub.1083827676', 'pub.1101390947', 'pub.1105249693', 'pub.1059418026', 'pub.1125461251', 'pub.1130108677', 'pub.1013822904', 'pub.1127155749', 'pub.1125804967', 'pub.1049377972', 'pub.1125825514', 'pub.1107801525', 'pub.1045068687', 'pub.1107561779', 'pub.1063740476', 'pub.1002562082', 'pub.1008281796', 'pub.1083687716', 'pub.1127442264', 'pub.1051664009', 'pub.1125942646', 'pub.1005518803', 'pub.1019068559', 'pub.1009356957', 'pub.1108780534', 'pub.1018809827', 'pub.1028270542', 'pub.1099939060', 'pub.1016726242', 'pub.1043807538', 'pub.1100320508', 'pub.1023467997', 'pub.1122780514', 'pub.1091233177', 'pub.1016242677', 'pub.1020605274', 'pub.1006417647', 'pub.1022172966', 'pub.1005126770', 'pub.1125942679', 'pub.1106907328', 'pub.1005138807', 'pub.1039130753', 'pub.1110929184']"

14,Is less readable liked better? The case of font readability in poetry appreciation,"Xin Gao, Jeroen Dera, Annabel D. Nijhof, Roel M. Willems",Public Library of Science (PLoS),2019-12-13,10.1371/journal.pone.0225757,pub.1123355269,"Previous research shows conflicting findings for the effect of font readability on comprehension and memory for language. It has been found that-perhaps counterintuitively-a hard to read font can be beneficial for language comprehension, especially for difficult language. Here we test how font readability influences the subjective experience of poetry reading. In three experiments we tested the influence of poem difficulty and font readability on the subjective experience of poems. We specifically predicted that font readability would have opposite effects on the subjective experience of easy versus difficult poems. Participants read poems which could be more or less difficult in terms of conceptual or structural aspects, and which were presented in a font that was either easy or more difficult to read. Participants read existing poems and subsequently rated their subjective experience (measured through four dependent variables: overall liking, perceived flow of the poem, perceived topic clarity, and perceived structure). In line with previous literature we observed a Poem Difficulty x Font Readability interaction effect for subjective measures of poetry reading. We found that participants rated easy poems as nicer when presented in an easy to read font, as compared to when presented in a hard to read font. Despite the presence of the interaction effect, we did not observe the predicted opposite effect for more difficult poems. We conclude that font readability can influence reading of easy and more difficult poems differentially, with strongest effects for easy poems.","This work was supported by an NWO Vidi grant (grant number 276-89-007) awarded to RW.

15,Adult attachment style and salivary alpha-amylase and emotional responses to a psychosocial stressor in women with eating disorders,"Giammarco Cascino, Valeria Ruzzi, Giulia D'Agostino, Eugenia Barone, Chiara Del Giorno, Palmiero Monteleone, Alessio Maria Monteleone",Elsevier,2021-12-24,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110713,pub.1144164232,"BACKGROUND: The fine-tuning of the endogenous stress response system, which includes the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), is influenced by early attachment relationships. A higher prevalence of insecure attachment has been detected in people with eating disorders (EDs). Thus, we investigated the emotional and the SNS reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in women with EDs in relation to their attachment profiles.
METHODS: Fifty women with EDs and 20 healthy women participated into an experimental study. Attachment was evaluated by Experience in Close Relationship questionnaire. Salivary α-amylase (sAA) levels were measured to assess the SNS reactivity to TSST while the emotional response was measured by the STAI state scale.
RESULTS: Compared to women with EDs and low attachment anxiety and healthy controls, women with EDs and high attachment anxiety showed lower TSST-induced sAA production without difference in anxiety scores. Women with EDs and high attachment avoidance showed similar sAA response to TSST but higher levels of anxiety scores compared to those with low attachment avoidance and healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings corroborate the idea that adult attachment may be associated with variability in emotional and biological responses to a psychosocial stressor in women with EDs.",,Journal of Psychosomatic Research,153,,0,,"['pub.1016030016', 'pub.1011430575', 'pub.1129538541', 'pub.1083371524', 'pub.1064299737', 'pub.1036599846', 'pub.1047111635', 'pub.1138137459', 'pub.1033497690', 'pub.1073421847', 'pub.1001187505', 'pub.1090900446', 'pub.1110890437', 'pub.1123812492', 'pub.1090815103', 'pub.1042577771', 'pub.1093022897', 'pub.1138140055', 'pub.1009531201', 'pub.1047852299', 'pub.1028272330', 'pub.1048561737', 'pub.1111314080', 'pub.1011484143', 'pub.1022295966', 'pub.1039910209', 'pub.1100913667', 'pub.1031681471', 'pub.1052148147', 'pub.1020696077', 'pub.1003072650', 'pub.1000765988', 'pub.1054008889', 'pub.1013501660', 'pub.1127761722', 'pub.1043056194', 'pub.1033656124', 'pub.1006014543', 'pub.1064289176', 'pub.1006691302', 'pub.1016722923', 'pub.1064321194', 'pub.1031915213', 'pub.1070773744', 'pub.1133287119', 'pub.1112606261']"

In the oral microbiome, this selectivity is crucial in preventing the proliferation of cariogenic species such as <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> (<i>S. mutans</i>). In this communication, coatings consisting of a covalently tethered hydroxylated azobenzene (OH-AAZO) on glassy acrylic resins are studied and characterized for their ability to selectively prevent the attachment and growth of oral <i>Streptococci</i> biofilms. The coating applied on the surface of glassy resins inhibits the growth and proliferation of cariogenic <i>S. mutans</i> and <i>S. oralis</i> biofilms while <i>A. actinomycetemcomitans</i>, <i>S. aureus</i>, and <i>E. coli</i> biofilms are unaffected by the coating . The antibacterial effect is characterized as a function of both the OH-AAZO concentration in the coatings (≥50 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) and the structure of the monomer in the coating. Preliminary mechanistic results suggest that the targeted bactericidal effect against <i>Streptococci</i> species is caused by a disruption of membrane ion potential, inducing cell death.","D.P.N. acknowledges financial support from National Institutes of Health‐National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (Grant No. K25DE027418).

18,Relative Deprivation and Prosocial Tendencies in Chinese Migrant Children: Testing an Integrated Model of Perceived Social Support and Group Identity,"Meng Xiong, Lei Xiao, Yiduo Ye",Frontiers,2021-06-08,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.658007,pub.1138687750,"As a particularly vulnerable group, children from rural areas in China whose families migrate to urban areas often encounter social exclusion, prejudice, and discrimination as they adjust to city life. Hence, migrant children may experience a sense of relative deprivation when they feel they are treated unjustly when compared to their urban counterparts. Although previous research has demonstrated that relative deprivation is a risk factor for prosocial tendencies, this association has not yet been examined in the population of migrant children in China. Further, few studies have revealed the mediating and moderating mechanisms between relative deprivation and prosocial tendencies. Therefore, this study constructed an integrated model examining the possible mediating role of perceived social support and moderating role of in-group identity on the association between relative deprivation and prosocial tendencies. A large sample of 1,630 Chinese rural-to-urban migrant children (845 girls; <i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 12.30, <i>SD</i> = 1.74) completed a battery of self-report questionnaires regarding relative deprivation, prosocial tendencies, perceived social support, in-group identity, and demographic variables. The results indicated that relative deprivation was negatively correlated with migrant children's prosocial tendencies and this connection was partially mediated by perceived social support. Moderated mediation analysis further indicated that in-group identity moderated the effect of perceived social support on prosocial tendencies, with a high level of in-group identity strengthening the positive association between perceived social support and prosocial tendencies. Parents, educators, and other members of society concerned about migrant children's psychosocial adaptation should provide adequate social support resources and help them foster positive in-group identity to migrant populations to mitigate the adverse effects of relative deprivation and promote their prosocial tendencies.",We thank all of the primary school and junior high school students who participated in our study.

These results were replicated in the main study, which also showed that older adults' perceived emotional support from fellow fans was positively associated with their sense of belonging which predicted their SWB. <b>Discussion:</b> The findings provide insights into how older adults may be engaged in meaningful forms of social life to help them maintain and enhance mental health.",The authors would like to thank Dr. Nyla Branscombe for her helpful feedback on an earlier draft of this article.,Journal of Aging and Health,32,7-8,18,"['Affect', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Identification, Psychological', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Self Report', 'Social Support', 'Sports', 'United States']","['pub.1020469514', 'pub.1102515586', 'pub.1069272615', 'pub.1103325136', 'pub.1032873597', 'pub.1022585912', 'pub.1051310858', 'pub.1016955982', 'pub.1048287082', 'pub.1018738841', 'pub.1042705278', 'pub.1039336250', 'pub.1002069469', 'pub.1016589506', 'pub.1023869622', 'pub.1025458452', 'pub.1027266393', 'pub.1032683987', 'pub.1017958614', 'pub.1106913293', 'pub.1101908482', 'pub.1017859096', 'pub.1059247212', 'pub.1006318683', 'pub.1043083431', 'pub.1036040350', 'pub.1051950459', 'pub.1059625806', 'pub.1022505236', 'pub.1052109870', 'pub.1085718904', 'pub.1090841978', 'pub.1034658634', 'pub.1032824869', 'pub.1062425966', 'pub.1040908718', 'pub.1018178076', 'pub.1053185667', 'pub.1051710211', 'pub.1047090585', 'pub.1004435584', 'pub.1035833669', 'pub.1013747584', 'pub.1012429872', 'pub.1019352169', 'pub.1085303928', 'pub.1058841102']"
22,"Change my body, change my mind: the effects of illusory ownership of an outgroup hand on implicit attitudes toward that outgroup","Harry Farmer, Lara Maister, Manos Tsakiris",Frontiers,2014,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.01016,pub.1019989634,"The effect of multisensory-induced changes on body-ownership and self-awareness using bodily illusions has been well established. More recently, experimental manipulation of bodily illusions have been combined with social cognition tasks to investigate whether changes in body-ownership can in turn change the way we perceive others. For example, experiencing ownership over a dark-skin rubber hand reduces implicit bias against dark-skin groups. Several studies have also shown that processing of skin color and facial features play an important role in judgements of racial typicality and racial categorization independently and in an additive manner. The present study aimed at examining whether using multisensory stimulation to induce feelings of body-ownership over a dark-skin rubber hand would lead to an increase in positive attitudes toward black faces. We here show, that the induced ownership of a body-part of a different skin color affected the participants' implicit attitudes when processing facial features, in addition to the processing of skin color shown previously. Furthermore, when the levels of pre-existing attitudes toward black people were taken into account, the effect of the rubber hand illusion on the post-stimulation implicit attitudes was only significant for those participants who had a negative initial attitude toward black people, with no significant effects found for those who had positive initial attitudes toward black people. Taken together, our findings corroborate the hypothesis that the representation of the self and its relation to others, as given to us by body-related multisensory processing, is critical in maintaining but also in changing social attitudes.

23,Enhanced mnemonic discrimination for emotional memories: the role of arousal in interference resolution,"Ágnes Szőllősi, Mihály Racsmány",Springer Nature,2020-04-20,10.3758/s13421-020-01035-3,pub.1126826542,"In the present study we investigated the long-standing question whether and why emotionally arousing memories are more distinct as compared to neutral experiences. We assumed that memory benefits from the distinctiveness of emotional information, and that emotions affect encoding by reducing interference among overlapping memory representations. Since pattern separation is the process which minimizes interference between memory representations with similar features, we examined the behavioral manifestation of putative neural mechanisms enabling pattern separation (i.e. mnemonic discrimination) for emotionally arousing materials using the Mnemonic Similarity Task with negative, positive, and neutral images as stimuli. Immediately after incidental encoding, subjects were presented with stimuli they had seen at encoding and also with new items. Crucially, participants were also presented with lure images that were visually similar to ones they had seen before. Response options were old, new, and similar. Our results showed that individuals were better in discriminating between similar, emotionally arousing memories, when compared to the neutral stimuli. Moreover, this so-called lure discrimination performance was better for the negative images, than it was for the positive stimuli. Finally, we showed that the high arousing negative stimuli were better separated than the low arousing negative stimuli, and a similar pattern of results was found for the positive items. Altogether, these findings suggest that lure discrimination is modulated by arousal and not by valence. We argue that noradrenergic activity might facilitate interference resolution among memory representations with similar features, and that superior pattern separation might play a key role in memory enhancement for emotional experiences.","This work was supported by the 2017-1.2.1-NKP-2017-00002 Research Grant (Hungarian Brain Research Program) and by the NKFI (National Research, Development and Innovation Office, Hungary) K124098 Research Grant.

24,Denying Humanity: The Distinct Neural Correlates of Blatant Dehumanization,"Emile Bruneau, Nir Jacoby, Nour Kteily, Rebecca Saxe",American Psychological Association (APA),2018-07,10.1037/xge0000417,pub.1104305268,"Recent behavioral work demonstrates that many people view low-status groups as less ""evolved and civilized"" than high-status groups. Are these people using blatant expressions of dehumanization simply to express strong dislike toward other groups? Or is blatant dehumanization a process distinct from other negative assessments? We tested these competing hypotheses using functional neuroimaging. Participants judged 10 groups (e.g., Europeans, Muslims, rats) on four scales: blatant dehumanization, dislike, dissimilarity and perceived within-group homogeneity. Consistent with expectations, neural responses when making ratings of dehumanization diverged from those when judging the same targets on the other related dimensions. Specifically, we found regions in the left inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) that were selectively parametrically modulated by dehumanization ratings. The pattern of responses in the left IFC was also consistent with animalistic dehumanization: high responses to low-status human groups and animals, and lower responses to high-status human groups. By contrast, a region in the posterior cingulate cortex was parametrically sensitive specifically to liking. We therefore demonstrate a double dissociation between brain activity associated with judgments of blatant dehumanization and judgments of dislike.

Gianotti, Daria Knoch",Oxford University Press (OUP),2013-04-10,10.1093/scan/nst023,pub.1040033692,"Individuals react to violation of social norms by outgroup members differently than to transgressions of those same norms by ingroup members: namely outgroup perpetrators are punished much more harshly than ingroup perpetrators. This parochial punishment pattern has been observed and extensively studied in social psychology and behavioral economics. Despite progress in recent years, however, little is known about the neural underpinnings of this intergroup bias. Here, we demonstrate by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that the transient disruption of the right, but not the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), reduces parochial punishment in a third-party punishment paradigm with real social groups. Moreover, we show that this observed TMS effect on parochial punishment is mediated by a classical punishment motive, i.e. retaliation. Finally, our data suggests that a change in perspective-taking might be the underlying mechanism that explains the impact of right TPJ disruption on retaliation motivation and parochial punishment. These findings provide the first causal evidence that the right TPJ plays a pivotal role in the implementation of parochial behaviors.

28,Analytic Thinking and Political Orientation in the Corona Crisis,"Marina Maglić, Tomislav Pavlović, Renata Franc",Frontiers,2021-07-22,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.631800,pub.1139859958,"With much unknown about the new coronavirus, the scientific consensus is that human hosts are crucial to its spread and reproduction-the more people behave like regular socializing beings they are, the more likely it is that the virus will propagate. Hence, many nations worldwide have mandated physical-distancing measures. In the current preregistered research, we focus on examining two factors that may help explain differences in adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors and policy support across different countries-political orientation and analytic thinking. We positioned our research within the dual-process framework of human reasoning and investigated the role of cognitive reflection, open-minded thinking, and political ideology in determining COVID-19 responsible behavior (physical distancing and maintaining hygiene) and support for restrictive COVID-19 policies on a sample of 12,490 participants from 17 countries. We have not been able to detect substantial relationships of political orientation with preventive behaviors and policy support, and overall found no reliable evidence of politicization, nor polarization regarding the issue. The results of structural equation modeling showed that the inclination towards COVID-19 preventive measures and their endorsement were defined primarily by the tendency of open-minded thinking. Specifically, open-minded thinking was shown to be a predictor of all three criteria-avoiding physical contact, maintaining physical hygiene, and supporting COVID-19 restrictive mitigation policies. Cognitive reflection was predictive of lesser adherence to stricter hygiene and only very weakly predictive of lesser policy support. Furthermore, there was no evidence of these effects varying across political contexts. The mediation analysis suggested a partial mediation effect of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs on the relationships of open-mindedness and cognitive reflection with physical distancing (but not adherence to stricter hygiene) and COVID-19 policy support, albeit very small and significant primarily due to sample size. There was also no evidence of these effects varying across political contexts. Finally, we have not been able to find strong evidence of political orientation modifying the relationship between analytical thinking and COVID-19 behaviors and policy support, although we explored the pattern of these effects in the US and Canadian samples for exploratory purposes and comparison with other similar studies.","We thank all the participants who took part in the study, all the colleagues, country team leaders, and supporting researchers, within the ICSMP (International Collaboration on the Social &amp; Moral Psychology of COVID-19) for their assistance with data collection.",Frontiers in Psychology,12,,0,,"['pub.1019804262', 'pub.1011439112', 'pub.1126736369', 'pub.1016367549', 'pub.1052517587', 'pub.1033594223', 'pub.1053378424', 'pub.1015092922', 'pub.1131433700', 'pub.1130759571', 'pub.1006529245', 'pub.1012085068', 'pub.1132248038', 'pub.1127241292', 'pub.1042593847', 'pub.1035348335', 'pub.1018679081', 'pub.1126376606', 'pub.1042185312', 'pub.1132979191', 'pub.1005552612', 'pub.1020004516', 'pub.1130475129', 'pub.1064525051', 'pub.1034266650', 'pub.1107796433', 'pub.1031800934', 'pub.1130812490', 'pub.1128669787', 'pub.1052753222', 'pub.1090431618', 'pub.1033870299', 'pub.1007687760', 'pub.1008899024', 'pub.1006426351', 'pub.1013685614', 'pub.1038177118', 'pub.1003936739', 'pub.1118142259', 'pub.1091221973', 'pub.1014119692', 'pub.1090293703', 'pub.1098701033', 'pub.1136847001', 'pub.1024891443', 'pub.1023846545', 'pub.1048472333', 'pub.1051533584', 'pub.1083855345', 'pub.1012672403', 'pub.1134001685', 'pub.1070451972', 'pub.1053384762', 'pub.1125934391', 'pub.1105010184', 'pub.1139192628', 'pub.1084169581', 'pub.1034484074', 'pub.1127155749', 'pub.1128884494', 'pub.1126041378', 'pub.1099546326', 'pub.1091952093', 'pub.1101401245', 'pub.1003173478', 'pub.1032297359', 'pub.1022946029', 'pub.1011264718', 'pub.1028229244', 'pub.1009157644', 'pub.1040725115', 'pub.1128922228', 'pub.1135715018', 'pub.1126935861', 'pub.1127555351', 'pub.1132641884', 'pub.1053118682', 'pub.1033074644', 'pub.1129902314', 'pub.1010228741', 'pub.1122778442', 'pub.1001234049', 'pub.1126733766', 'pub.1008716246', 'pub.1135470350', 'pub.1038436273', 'pub.1083861033', 'pub.1019773456', 'pub.1068672719', 'pub.1044852112', 'pub.1108389794', 'pub.1101653570', 'pub.1126689536', 'pub.1049212302', 'pub.1103549243', 'pub.1132976031', 'pub.1128773414', 'pub.1136989674', 'pub.1138366157', 'pub.1046076925', 'pub.1127384660', 'pub.1028060773', 'pub.1083913819', 'pub.1047794258', 'pub.1039711963', 'pub.1135285293', 'pub.1084116107', 'pub.1136211756', 'pub.1018291850', 'pub.1012105044', 'pub.1038926101', 'pub.1033128645', 'pub.1107799556', 'pub.1123960880', 'pub.1128835532', 'pub.1088040730', 'pub.1020957241', 'pub.1011029692', 'pub.1009581729', 'pub.1136855924', 'pub.1090427219', 'pub.1000400222', 'pub.1136544029', 'pub.1012492399', 'pub.1100315416', 'pub.1038569720', 'pub.1035717869', 'pub.1126993152', 'pub.1022237670', 'pub.1040618689', 'pub.1126995296', 'pub.1011794707', 'pub.1002962710', 'pub.1012815042', 'pub.1129145556', 'pub.1129582994', 'pub.1042441425', 'pub.1033467594', 'pub.1029397339', 'pub.1128141081', 'pub.1091295930', 'pub.1085729582', 'pub.1130460252', 'pub.1098703146', 'pub.1027091475', 'pub.1029349632', 'pub.1030234038', 'pub.1129045997', 'pub.1109740219', 'pub.1110784012', 'pub.1000478887']"

We begin by discussing the evolution and current functioning of the moral foundations on which our framework rests. Next, we discuss the possible applications of such an evolutionarily-informed ethical framework to several domains of human behavior, namely: sexual maturation, mate attraction, intrasexual competition, culture, and the separation between various academic disciplines. Finally, we discuss ways in which an evolutionary awareness can inform our cross-generational activities-which we refer to as ""intergenerational extended phenotypes""-by helping us to construct a better future for ourselves, for other sentient beings, and for our environment.

A strengths-focused evaluation approach has great promise for empowering individuals, groups, communities, and organizations, and identifying program strengths to build upon in addition to illuminating program deficits. However, there is a dearth of literature on using a strengths approach to evaluate interventions and programs to promote social justice. Drawing from the two disciplines of positive psychology and evaluation, this article illustrates a strengths-focused approach to formative evaluation using a case example of a halfway house for previously incarcerated women. The findings exemplify the positive psychological phenomena that emerge as a result of focusing the evaluation on program strengths. The case demonstrates that the application of a strengths-focused approach to evaluating social justice interventions can be empowering for institutions and the communities they serve.","Special thanks to Dr. Tash Wilder for support in project coordination, study design, data collection, analysis, and report writing, and Dr. Natalie Sappleton and to the members of the Academy of Management conference for feedback on a previous version of the paper.",Evaluation and Program Planning,,,0,,"['pub.1007488207', 'pub.1071011756', 'pub.1059974977', 'pub.1133579404', 'pub.1126503671', 'pub.1006623993', 'pub.1060042623', 'pub.1117021523', 'pub.1033915892', 'pub.1045585155', 'pub.1111768083', 'pub.1037413213', 'pub.1078435668', 'pub.1030092522', 'pub.1113490610', 'pub.1000014500', 'pub.1027880662', 'pub.1029431500', 'pub.1063569645', 'pub.1033982321', 'pub.1049049864', 'pub.1028343910', 'pub.1052235306', 'pub.1022226958', 'pub.1139725760', 'pub.1110966839', 'pub.1019447243', 'pub.1026319093', 'pub.1023141846', 'pub.1039202380', 'pub.1045290782', 'pub.1078348530', 'pub.1113293053', 'pub.1033787395', 'pub.1034745719', 'pub.1051058813', 'pub.1139737575', 'pub.1139527870', 'pub.1071011755', 'pub.1134047229', 'pub.1073375327', 'pub.1006781477', 'pub.1028464291', 'pub.1043252106', 'pub.1099091419', 'pub.1047941933', 'pub.1001480100', 'pub.1139853696', 'pub.1042323759', 'pub.1049219446', 'pub.1062424776', 'pub.1050964480', 'pub.1020073247', 'pub.1070194681', 'pub.1031942376', 'pub.1024478385', 'pub.1111420305', 'pub.1028092988', 'pub.1043201862', 'pub.1008056191', 'pub.1012184252', 'pub.1002160650', 'pub.1009084550', 'pub.1113143474', 'pub.1134911491', 'pub.1028898702', 'pub.1005637698', 'pub.1087892920']"

First, we categorize these students into three analytically distinct orientations regarding Donald Trump and his presidency (or what we call Trumpism). There are principled rejecters, true believers, and satisficed partisans. We argue that Trumpism is a disunifying symbol in our respondents’ self-narratives. Specifically, right-leaning collegians use Trumpism to draw distinctions over the appropriate meaning of conservatism. Second, we show how political clubs sort and shape orientations to Trumpism. As such, our work reveals how student-led groups can play a significant role in making different political discourses available on campuses and shaping the types of activism pursued by club members—both of which have potentially serious implications for the content and character of American democracy moving forward.","We want to thank the anonymous reviewers at Qualitative Sociology for their insightful comments and helpful critiques in improving our manuscript.

I highlight multiple linkages between asymmetric intergroup conflict as modeled with the attacker-defender game and negotiation research and illustrate how the proposed model of attacker-defender conflicts can inspire new research on intergroup negotiation.,,Behavioral and Brain Sciences,42,,1,['Negotiating'],"['pub.1007756410', 'pub.1007058949', 'pub.1000834894', 'pub.1002800737', 'pub.1038145655', 'pub.1063626273', 'pub.1040333448', 'pub.1045435889', 'pub.1004829459', 'pub.1030694179', 'pub.1012806935', 'pub.1047225363', 'pub.1032720718', 'pub.1014249595']"

34,A descriptive literature review of phubbing behaviors,"Estefanía Capilla Garrido, Tomayess Issa, Prudencia Gutiérrez Esteban, Sixto Cubo Delgado",Elsevier,2021-05-18,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07037,pub.1138152239,"The practice of phubbing has become an emerging phenomenon of worldwide interest to researchers. The cause is due to the fact that smartphones are ubiquitous and are often used in co-present interactions. This behavior is generally considered inappropriate and is called ""phubbing"". Phubbing, as described by Chotpitayasunondh and Douglas (2018), is the act of snubbing someone in a social setting by looking at one's phone instead of paying attention to the other person. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of research studies on phubbing through a review of the current literature. To do this, a search was carried out in an international database, finding 84 relevant articles in English that appeared in peer-reviewed journals published between 2012, the year in which the term 'phubbing' appears, and January 2020. The review covers the main fields of research studies on phubbing behaviors. Likewise, the results of the study show the distribution of published articles on phubbing by year that detail the type of study and the methodological approach and, finally, the research journals that have published articles on phubbing. The results of this review are expected to stimulate and guide future research in this field.",,Heliyon,7,5,3,,"['pub.1091914126', 'pub.1101292978', 'pub.1128380044', 'pub.1092557786', 'pub.1037288035', 'pub.1137275594', 'pub.1004097390', 'pub.1017748481', 'pub.1025029280', 'pub.1105548367', 'pub.1107825317', 'pub.1002753435', 'pub.1085456125', 'pub.1069286498', 'pub.1079091090', 'pub.1120006595', 'pub.1084671317', 'pub.1107707091', 'pub.1064732668', 'pub.1067872695', 'pub.1004731082', 'pub.1101455283', 'pub.1104991244', 'pub.1130878406', 'pub.1031928979', 'pub.1126995002', 'pub.1119772637', 'pub.1023836945', 'pub.1103718144', 'pub.1052611128', 'pub.1034528186', 'pub.1023567044', 'pub.1122748354', 'pub.1068065163', 'pub.1090563177', 'pub.1067872700', 'pub.1084671939', 'pub.1122101869', 'pub.1101754582', 'pub.1026632271', 'pub.1049576937', 'pub.1111503456']"

The resulting six profiles document heterogeneity in meaning-making and personal impacts across youth. Individual and social factors including race and ethnic identity varied across profiles. Many students of color expressed fear and vigilance toward racial violence while many White students expressed sadness and sympathy.

36,What Bias Management Can Learn From Change Management? Utilizing Change Framework to Review and Explore Bias Strategies,Mai Nguyen-Phuong-Mai,Frontiers,2021-12-15,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.644145,pub.1143859013,"This paper conducted a preliminary study of reviewing and exploring bias strategies using a framework of a different discipline: change management. The hypothesis here is: If the major problem of implicit bias strategies is that they do not translate into actual changes in behaviors, then it could be helpful to learn from studies that have contributed to successful change interventions such as reward management, social neuroscience, health behavioral change, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The result of this integrated approach is: (1) current bias strategies can be improved and new ones can be developed with insight from adjunct study fields in change management; (2) it could be more sustainable to invest in a holistic and proactive bias strategy approach that targets the social environment, eliminating the very condition under which biases arise; and (3) while implicit biases are automatic, future studies should invest more on strategies that empower people as ""change agents"" who can act proactively to regulate the very environment that gives rise to their biased thoughts and behaviors.",,Frontiers in Psychology,12,,0,,"['pub.1015471088', 'pub.1103159599', 'pub.1002993359', 'pub.1008500086', 'pub.1067669902', 'pub.1012368916', 'pub.1001409785', 'pub.1031755025', 'pub.1010997136', 'pub.1007154118', 'pub.1040136229', 'pub.1091867369', 'pub.1033075885', 'pub.1048394543', 'pub.1011025172', 'pub.1064733040', 'pub.1105008384', 'pub.1087310561', 'pub.1107062795', 'pub.1000892568', 'pub.1099867237', 'pub.1046771396', 'pub.1124100548', 'pub.1060023862', 'pub.1072894473', 'pub.1030258591', 'pub.1038690015', 'pub.1051813533', 'pub.1013555759', 'pub.1031351404', 'pub.1031810791', 'pub.1014590816', 'pub.1090284299', 'pub.1103418743', 'pub.1019626153', 'pub.1083861019', 'pub.1000284870', 'pub.1005294596', 'pub.1035349442', 'pub.1023457674', 'pub.1003366389', 'pub.1006329326', 'pub.1007000615', 'pub.1051745480', 'pub.1005929158', 'pub.1051220142', 'pub.1114499489', 'pub.1007183817', 'pub.1059263041', 'pub.1017035481', 'pub.1106054532', 'pub.1010198412', 'pub.1052266152', 'pub.1017244582', 'pub.1103306794', 'pub.1047217789', 'pub.1028604198', 'pub.1064218688', 'pub.1027618038', 'pub.1051255478', 'pub.1051744059', 'pub.1014369977', 'pub.1091685952', 'pub.1019563089', 'pub.1069757422', 'pub.1031607119', 'pub.1047226013', 'pub.1044064825', 'pub.1051183504', 'pub.1121091525', 'pub.1061949297', 'pub.1056394808', 'pub.1045340351', 'pub.1044649820', 'pub.1092330516', 'pub.1037391201', 'pub.1058846192', 'pub.1034075416', 'pub.1035427100', 'pub.1125338757', 'pub.1056347335', 'pub.1008853223', 'pub.1014304202', 'pub.1053913935', 'pub.1091334584', 'pub.1117131813', 'pub.1127379553', 'pub.1108235832', 'pub.1105724084', 'pub.1032975784', 'pub.1108694616', 'pub.1002303848', 'pub.1010979591', 'pub.1117480226', 'pub.1039036256', 'pub.1035455743', 'pub.1017928896', 'pub.1051681167', 'pub.1062639196', 'pub.1089041619', 'pub.1123673691', 'pub.1078789009', 'pub.1040759862', 'pub.1110603582', 'pub.1050113407', 'pub.1074851176', 'pub.1050090523', 'pub.1052304924', 'pub.1004697828', 'pub.1125917231', 'pub.1050337487', 'pub.1036952978', 'pub.1014459279', 'pub.1028456568', 'pub.1000293684', 'pub.1119789035', 'pub.1031089567', 'pub.1001400014', 'pub.1125716494', 'pub.1007128992', 'pub.1040130935', 'pub.1003446708', 'pub.1006838632', 'pub.1125156900', 'pub.1001091901', 'pub.1090519416', 'pub.1015569662', 'pub.1003420416', 'pub.1028087755', 'pub.1008984423', 'pub.1004659311', 'pub.1107418382', 'pub.1043360132', 'pub.1015791838', 'pub.1004853705', 'pub.1087928741', 'pub.1013113012', 'pub.1047376435', 'pub.1025808020', 'pub.1008895960', 'pub.1091467954', 'pub.1107381120', 'pub.1032554492', 'pub.1049453186', 'pub.1031790516', 'pub.1029351478', 'pub.1100821784', 'pub.1033031483', 'pub.1045072451', 'pub.1128969391', 'pub.1018367901', 'pub.1107325621', 'pub.1053597007', 'pub.1015138093', 'pub.1001764987', 'pub.1019957301', 'pub.1033970151', 'pub.1106524310', 'pub.1002631847', 'pub.1021880123', 'pub.1040278615', 'pub.1040086155', 'pub.1101727222', 'pub.1024080979', 'pub.1046580372', 'pub.1005415554']"

On a theoretical level, most contemporary models propose that mindfulness training impacts self-related processes. In this review, the empirical evidence for this hypothesis is examined and discussed. Overall, very few self-related processes have been measured in randomized controlled trials of mindfulness-based interventions to date, and, of those processes that have been measured, only negative self-rumination improved significantly. The data so far remain inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based interventions have an impact on other self-related processes.

This study investigated whether people with obesity are blatantly dehumanized (i.e., explicitly considered to be less human and more animallike) and whether this predicts obesity discrimination.
METHODS: In four online studies (total N = 1,506) with American, British, and Indian participants, evidence for blatant dehumanization of people with obesity was examined. Whether blatant dehumanization of people with obesity was moderated by BMI and to what extent blatant dehumanization predicted support for weight discrimination were also investigated.
RESULTS: In all studies, participants believed that people with obesity were less evolved and less human than people without obesity. Although blatant dehumanization of people with obesity was most pronounced among thinner participants, the belief that people with obesity were less human was also observed among participants with class I obesity. Finally, dehumanization was predictive of support for policies that discriminate against people living with obesity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that people with obesity are blatantly dehumanized. This tendency to consider people with obesity as less human reveals the level of obesity stigma and may facilitate and/or justify weight discrimination.",,Obesity,27,6,17,"['Adult', 'Dehumanization', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity', 'Social Stigma']","['pub.1013877625', 'pub.1028946490', 'pub.1026086801', 'pub.1014624636', 'pub.1067636417', 'pub.1040688411', 'pub.1052532233', 'pub.1011681848', 'pub.1012627605', 'pub.1040316448', 'pub.1104305268', 'pub.1029443760', 'pub.1034729569', 'pub.1007238441', 'pub.1023464117', 'pub.1093037307', 'pub.1024585197', 'pub.1012676088', 'pub.1092450034', 'pub.1049013771', 'pub.1093056757', 'pub.1090903736', 'pub.1028130894', 'pub.1092184365', 'pub.1022283762', 'pub.1067636733', 'pub.1011570113', 'pub.1030544968', 'pub.1021417696', 'pub.1085464664', 'pub.1039939631', 'pub.1022152158', 'pub.1045311486', 'pub.1007470716', 'pub.1090894434']"

METHOD: We recruited 1,606 participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk for three online surveys.
RESULTS: The tendency to ascribe profundity to randomly generated sentences-pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity-correlates positively with perceptions of fake news accuracy, and negatively with the ability to differentiate between fake and real news (media truth discernment). Relatedly, individuals who overclaim their level of knowledge also judge fake news to be more accurate. We also extend previous research indicating that analytic thinking correlates negatively with perceived accuracy by showing that this relationship is not moderated by the presence/absence of the headline's source (which has no effect on accuracy), or by familiarity with the headlines (which correlates positively with perceived accuracy of fake and real news).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that belief in fake news may be driven, to some extent, by a general tendency to be overly accepting of weak claims. This tendency, which we refer to as reflexive open-mindedness, may be partly responsible for the prevalence of epistemically suspect beliefs writ large.","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Preparation of this manuscript was supported by the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Initiative of the Miami Foundation and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",Journal of Personality,88,2,198,"['Adult', 'Deception', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Personality', 'Recognition, Psychology', 'Social Media', 'Thinking']","['pub.1085420370', 'pub.1004685036', 'pub.1031268374', 'pub.1111650526', 'pub.1056368321', 'pub.1006849432', 'pub.1002506478', 'pub.1085559980', 'pub.1090840945', 'pub.1085319721', 'pub.1085436236', 'pub.1031030859', 'pub.1035348335', 'pub.1053841988', 'pub.1092019615', 'pub.1042185312', 'pub.1049590188', 'pub.1117009340', 'pub.1101382661', 'pub.1064525051', 'pub.1126992414', 'pub.1107796433', 'pub.1049436349', 'pub.1107188281', 'pub.1021632065', 'pub.1050493105', 'pub.1032082133', 'pub.1109738153', 'pub.1026575669', 'pub.1083855345', 'pub.1101380916', 'pub.1033484281', 'pub.1052605530', 'pub.1122266655', 'pub.1112075009', 'pub.1105010184', 'pub.1053311550', 'pub.1037767206', 'pub.1085467005', 'pub.1053118682', 'pub.1005512926', 'pub.1084197104', 'pub.1001234049', 'pub.1004053543', 'pub.1008716246', 'pub.1046428558', 'pub.1073453864', 'pub.1038436273', 'pub.1024924324', 'pub.1009990026', 'pub.1101525778', 'pub.1046076925', 'pub.1047794258', 'pub.1044459543', 'pub.1042973893', 'pub.1107799556', 'pub.1001980645', 'pub.1084085028', 'pub.1120384147', 'pub.1030807461', 'pub.1011029692', 'pub.1024606827', 'pub.1011400707', 'pub.1090427219', 'pub.1014844997', 'pub.1024421768', 'pub.1023195707', 'pub.1008888543', 'pub.1022237670', 'pub.1102364280', 'pub.1021120684', 'pub.1033467594', 'pub.1011806145', 'pub.1029397339', 'pub.1111751640', 'pub.1091295930', 'pub.1085729582', 'pub.1030234038', 'pub.1109740219', 'pub.1053701210', 'pub.1028282128', 'pub.1111308730']"

46,Pupil size and social vigilance in rhesus macaques,"R. Becket Ebitz, John M. Pearson, Michael L. Platt",Frontiers,2014-05-06,10.3389/fnins.2014.00100,pub.1025308267,"Complex natural environments favor the dynamic alignment of neural processing between goal-relevant stimuli and conflicting but biologically salient stimuli like social competitors or predators. The biological mechanisms that regulate dynamic changes in vigilance have not been fully elucidated. Arousal systems that ready the body to respond adaptively to threat may contribute to dynamic regulation of vigilance. Under conditions of constant luminance, pupil diameter provides a peripheral index of arousal state. Although pupil size varies with the processing of goal-relevant stimuli, it remains unclear whether pupil size also predicts attention to biologically salient objects and events like social competitors, whose presence interferes with current goals. Here we show that pupil size in rhesus macaques both reflects the biological salience of task-irrelevant social distractors and predicts vigilance for these stimuli. We measured pupil size in monkeys performing a visual orienting task in which distractors-monkey faces and phase-scrambled versions of the same images-could appear in a congruent, incongruent, or neutral position relative to a rewarded target. Baseline pupil size under constant illumination predicted distractor interference, consistent with the hypothesis that pupil-linked arousal mechanisms regulate task engagement and distractibility. Notably, pupil size also predicted enhanced vigilance for social distractors, suggesting that pupil-linked arousal may adjust the balance of processing resources between goal-relevant and biologically important stimuli. The magnitude of pupil constriction in response to distractors closely tracked distractor interference, saccade planning and the social relevance of distractors, endorsing the idea that the pupillary light response is modulated by attention. These findings indicate that pupil size indexes dynamic changes in attention evoked by both the social environment and arousal.

47,Mindfulness and Leadership: Communication as a Behavioral Correlate of Leader Mindfulness and Its Effect on Follower Satisfaction,"Johannes F. W. Arendt, Armin Pircher Verdorfer, Katharina G. Kugler",Frontiers,2019-03-29,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00667,pub.1113051572,"In recent years, the construct of mindfulness has gained growing attention in psychological research. However, little is known about the effects of mindfulness on interpersonal interactions and social relationships at work. Addressing this gap, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of mindfulness in leader-follower relationships. Building on prior research, we hypothesize that leaders' mindfulness is reflected in a specific communication style (""mindfulness in communication""), which is positively related to followers' satisfaction with their leaders. We used nested survey data from 34 leaders and 98 followers from various organizations and tested mediation hypotheses using hierarchical linear modeling. Our hypotheses were confirmed by our data in that leaders' self-reported mindfulness showed a positive relationship with several aspects of followers' satisfaction. This relationship was fully mediated by leaders' mindfulness in communication as perceived by their followers. Our findings emphasize the potential value of mindfulness in workplace settings. They provide empirical evidence for a positive link between leaders' dispositional mindfulness and the wellbeing of their followers, indicating that mindfulness is not solely an individual resource but also fosters interpersonal skills. By examining leaders' mindfulness in communication as an explanatory process, we created additional clarification about <i>how</i> leaders' mindfulness relates to followers' perceptions, offering a promising starting point for measuring behavioral correlates of leader mindfulness.","The authors thank Felix C.

DESIGN: This was a qualitative study deploying in-depth, individual interviews, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used for coding.
PARTICIPANTS: This study involved 25 participants from a range of frontline professions in health and social care.
SETTING: Interviews were conducted over the phone or video call, depending on participant preference.
RESULTS: From the analysis, we identified 5 overarching themes: communication challenges, work-related stressors, support structures, personal growth and individual resilience. The participants expressed difficulties such as communication challenges and changing work conditions, but also positive factors such as increased team unity at work, and a greater reflection on what matters in life.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence on the support needs of health and social care professionals amid continued and future disruptions caused by the pandemic. It also elucidates some of the successful strategies (such as mindfulness, hobbies, restricting news intake, virtual socialising activities) deployed by health and social care professionals that can support their resilience and well-being and be used to guide future interventions.","The authors would like to thank other members of the qualitative COVID-19 social study team at UCL, who helped discuss themes during the analysis stages at weekly team meetings: Dr Thomas May, Dr Anna Roberts and Dr Joanna Dawes.",BMJ Open,11,2,35,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'COVID-19', 'Female', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pandemics', 'Qualitative Research', 'Social Workers', 'United Kingdom']","['pub.1048983391', 'pub.1063606149', 'pub.1126000974', 'pub.1043699420', 'pub.1103996200', 'pub.1125411814', 'pub.1125858806', 'pub.1125713384', 'pub.1006039333', 'pub.1132361355', 'pub.1130287451', 'pub.1129419456', 'pub.1101289412', 'pub.1028903500', 'pub.1032997221', 'pub.1126272573', 'pub.1014883248', 'pub.1028109558', 'pub.1047336522', 'pub.1038583744', 'pub.1029185236', 'pub.1003106780', 'pub.1127711185', 'pub.1125924853', 'pub.1091018168', 'pub.1022590952', 'pub.1127956117', 'pub.1124624107', 'pub.1126110943', 'pub.1125759683', 'pub.1116519782', 'pub.1018198667', 'pub.1132419494', 'pub.1040137765', 'pub.1125642597', 'pub.1056345296', 'pub.1024794908', 'pub.1079202869', 'pub.1126635979', 'pub.1129710420', 'pub.1117133202', 'pub.1020453350', 'pub.1126150003', 'pub.1045082963']"

Halpern, Oriel FeldmanHall",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2021-05-13,10.1073/pnas.2022491118,pub.1138041630,"Political partisans see the world through an ideologically biased lens. What drives political polarization? Although it has been posited that polarization arises because of an inability to tolerate uncertainty and a need to hold predictable beliefs about the world, evidence for this hypothesis remains elusive. We examined the relationship between uncertainty tolerance and political polarization using a combination of brain-to-brain synchrony and intersubject representational similarity analysis, which measured committed liberals' and conservatives' (<i>n</i> = 44) subjective interpretation of naturalistic political video material. Shared ideology between participants increased neural synchrony throughout the brain during a polarizing political debate filled with provocative language but not during a neutrally worded news clip on polarized topics or a nonpolitical documentary. During the political debate, neural synchrony in mentalizing and valuation networks was modulated by one's aversion to uncertainty: Uncertainty-intolerant individuals experienced greater brain-to-brain synchrony with politically like-minded peers and lower synchrony with political opponents-an effect observed for liberals and conservatives alike. Moreover, the greater the neural synchrony between committed partisans, the more likely that two individuals formed similar, polarized attitudes about the debate. These results suggest that uncertainty attitudes gate the shared neural processing of political narratives, thereby fueling polarized attitude formation about hot-button issues.","This work was supported by the Brown University Office of the Vice President for Research Seed Fund Award GR300152 and NIH Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence grant P20GM103645.

51,Implications of Research Staff Demographics for Psychological Science,"Serena Does, Naomi Ellemers, John F. Dovidio, Jasmine B. Norman, Avital Mentovich, Romy van der Lee, Phillip Atiba Goff",American Psychological Association (APA),2018-07,10.1037/amp0000199,pub.1101298850,"Long-standing research traditions in psychology have established the fundamental impact of social categories, such as race and gender, on people's perceptions of themselves and others, as well as on general human cognition and behavior. However, there is a general tendency to ignore research staff demographics (e.g., researchers' race and gender) in research development and research reports. Variation in research staff demographics can exert systematic and scientifically informative influences on results from psychological research. Consequently, research staff demographics need to be considered, studied, and/or reported, along with how these demographics were allowed to vary across participants or conditions (e.g., random assignment, matched with participant demographics, or included as a factor in the experimental design). In addition to providing an overview of multidisciplinary evidence of research staff demographics effects, it is discussed how research staff demographics might influence research findings through (a) ingroup versus outgroup effects, (b) stereotype and (implicit) bias effects, and (c) priming and social tuning effects. Finally, an overview of recommended considerations is included (see Appendix) to help illustrate how to systematically incorporate relevant research staff demographics in psychological science.

53,Toward a brain theory of meditation,"Antonino Raffone, Laura Marzetti, Cosimo Del Gratta, Mauro Gianni Perrucci, Gian Luca Romani, Vittorio Pizzella",Elsevier,2019-01-03,10.1016/bs.pbr.2018.10.028,pub.1111078548,"The rapidly progressing science of meditation has led to insights about the neural correlates of focused attention meditation (FAM), open monitoring meditation (OMM), compassion meditation (CM) and loving kindness meditation (LKM), in terms of states and traits. However, a unified theoretical understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in meditation-related functions, including mindfulness, is lacking. After reviewing the main forms of meditation and their relationships, the major brain networks and brain states, as well as influential theoretical views of consciousness, we outline a Brain Theory of Meditation (BTM). BTM takes the lead from considerations about the roles of the major brain networks, i.e., the central executive, salience and default mode networks, and their interplay, in meditation, and from an essential energetic limitation of the human brain, such that only up to 1% of the neurons in the cortex can be concurrently activated. The development of the theory is also guided by our neuroscientific studies with the outstanding participation of Theravada Buddhist monks, with other relevant findings in literature. BTM suggests mechanisms for the different forms of meditation, with the down-regulation of brain network activities in FAM, the gating and tuning of network coupling in OMM, and state-related up-regulation effects in CM and LKM. The theory also advances a leftward asymmetry in top-down regulation, and an enhanced inter-hemispheric integration, in meditation states and traits, also with implications for a theoretical understanding of conscious access. Meditation thus provides a meta-function for an efficient brain/mind regulation, and a flexible allocation of highly limited and often constrained (e.g., by negative emotion and mind wandering) brain activity resources, which can be related to mindfulness. Finally, a series of experimental predictions is derived from the theory.","We would like to dedicate this work to Prof. Chandrasekhar Pammi of the University of Allahabad who suddenly passed away in February 2018, with our acknowledgments of his contributions to research on cognitive and computational neuroscience aspects of decision making, sequence learning and spatial navigation, as well as of his outstanding humanity and kindness.

54,When and Why Does Employee Creativity Fuel Deviance? Key Psychological Mechanisms,"Thomas W. H. Ng, Kai Chi Yam",American Psychological Association (APA),2019-09,10.1037/apl0000397,pub.1112098473,"Drawing on self-enhancement theory, we propose that, intraindividually, employees tend to give themselves credit when they engage in creativity. Perceived creative credit, in turn, activates multiple psychological motives that ultimately affect deviance. On the one hand, perceived creative credit is associated with greater creativity-driven norm-breaking motives and greater entitlement motives, which in turn should increase deviance. On the other hand, perceived creative credit is associated with greater image preservation motives, which in turn should decrease deviance. A within-person study involving 206 employees and their coworkers conducted over a 10-day period provided broad support for the proposed model. In addition, a between-person variable, namely rewards for creativity, moderated the self-crediting process. The within-person serial mediation relationship between creativity and deviance was positive and significant for employees who perceived low rewards for creativity, but was not significant for those who perceived high rewards for creativity. In other words, rewards for creativity in the workplace effectively nullified this within-person self-crediting mechanism among employees. This study thus illustrates that, within individuals, creativity and deviance are related through perceived creative credit and different psychological motives (i.e., serial mediation). However, the strength of this serial mediation relationship varies depending on the availability of formal rewards for creativity (i.e., moderated serial mediation).

57,The Importance of WE in POWER: Integrating Police Wellness and Ethics,"Daniel M. Blumberg, Konstantinos Papazoglou, Michael D. Schlosser",Frontiers,2020-12-18,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.614995,pub.1133585647,"In this article, the authors introduce the POWER perspective of police wellness and ethics. POWER stands for Police Officer Wellness, Ethics, and Resilience. The perspective represents the view that wellness and ethics cannot be discussed separately; they are inextricably connected to each other. Initiatives to address one should always, simultaneously, include the other. Although there is a need for wellness and ethics to be addressed on an organizational level, the present article emphasizes the importance of POWER for individual police officers. The authors make the argument that officers need to expand the way in which they conceptualize their own wellness to include efforts to maintain ethical decision-making. Specifically, officers will remain psychologically healthier when they take active steps to stay steadfastly committed to their ethical principles. Likewise, officers who utilize a comprehensive wellness program, including strategies to boost resilience, will be far less likely to experience lapses in ethical decision-making. Further recommendations for action and implication of this matter in law enforcement are presented and discussed.",,Frontiers in Psychology,11,,2,,"['pub.1124284819', 'pub.1088001874', 'pub.1046415779', 'pub.1043472539', 'pub.1127196664', 'pub.1063982004', 'pub.1113873432', 'pub.1125334904', 'pub.1111635972', 'pub.1131818387', 'pub.1025333638', 'pub.1124292572', 'pub.1105412667', 'pub.1096035262', 'pub.1052355739', 'pub.1064222190', 'pub.1036939186', 'pub.1107844438', 'pub.1130890505', 'pub.1016346938', 'pub.1124301535', 'pub.1053880097', 'pub.1100682892', 'pub.1063981933', 'pub.1018209648', 'pub.1093068900']"

Rand, Gordon Pennycook",SAGE Publications,2021-05-31,10.1177/1368430220965709,pub.1138487417,"A major focus of current research is understanding why people fall for and share fake news on social media. While much research focuses on understanding the role of personality-level traits for those who share the news, such as partisanship and analytic thinking, characteristics of the articles themselves have not been studied. Across two pre-registered studies, we examined whether character-deprecation headlines - headlines designed to deprecate someone's character, but which have no impact on policy or legislation - increased the likelihood of self-reported sharing on social media. In Study 1 we harvested fake news items from online sources and compared sharing intentions between Republicans and Democrats. Results showed that, compared to Democrats, Republicans had greater intention to share character-deprecation headlines compared to news with policy implications. We then applied these findings experimentally. In Study 2 we developed a set of fake news items that was matched for content across pro-Democratic and pro-Republican headlines and across news focusing on a specific person (e.g., <i>Trump</i>) versus a generic person (e.g., <i>a Republican</i>). We found that, contrary to Study 1, Republicans were no more inclined toward character deprecation than Democrats. However, these findings suggest that while character assassination may be a feature of pro-Republican news, it is not more attractive to Republicans versus Democrats. News with policy implications, whether fake or real, seems consistently more attractive to members of both parties regardless of whether it attempts to deprecate an opponent's character. Thus, character deprecation in fake news may in be in supply, but not in demand.",,Group Processes & Intergroup Relations,24,4,2,,"['pub.1111788955', 'pub.1128884494', 'pub.1124797127', 'pub.1107799556', 'pub.1120691079', 'pub.1120384147', 'pub.1125748361', 'pub.1107188281', 'pub.1123960880', 'pub.1111650526', 'pub.1113155690', 'pub.1091450204', 'pub.1117478084', 'pub.1112072550', 'pub.1085319721', 'pub.1126716940', 'pub.1126123252', 'pub.1123826836', 'pub.1035348335', 'pub.1124028507', 'pub.1123698595', 'pub.1126992089', 'pub.1009990026', 'pub.1125450609', 'pub.1101382661', 'pub.1101380916', 'pub.1124583173', 'pub.1122816952', 'pub.1038097502', 'pub.1111751640', 'pub.1126995346', 'pub.1124768614', 'pub.1105010184', 'pub.1017715853', 'pub.1101226804', 'pub.1049436349', 'pub.1111308730']"

60,Models of Cognition and Their Applications in Behavioral Economics: A Conceptual Framework for Nudging Derived From Behavior Analysis and Relational Frame Theory,"Marco Tagliabue, Valeria Squatrito, Giovambattista Presti",Frontiers,2019-11-01,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02418,pub.1122254170,"This paper puts forward a rounder conceptual model for interpreting short- and long-term effects of choice behavior. As a further development of dual-process theory, Kahneman (2003) distinguished between intuition and reasoning, which served as the respective precursors of the cognitive processing systems 1 and 2. We maintain that they reflect the more rigorous distinction between brief and immediate and extended and elaborated relational responding, which may be reinterpreted through an analysis of their functional properties. Repertoires of relational responding are offered by the multi-dimensional multi-level model. Specifically, we provide a conceptual account of how nudging, or the manipulation of environmental contingencies, works on the creation and modification of relational framing. Educative nudges, or boosts, are a subset of nudges that may more easily maintain target choice behavior in the future. The central role of verbal behavior is essential toward formulating rules, which inform and guide choice behavior over time. Although nudges are traditionally regarded as System 1-steered aspects, they are herein regarded as cues for responding to relational frames, which may induce System 2-steered aspects. We suggest adopting the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) to inform how coherent and immediate responding to novel relational responding may occur in the presence of choice behavior. Several examples are included to support the claim of encompassing relational responding and choice behavior. We address the instances of consumer behavior, stereotypy and prejudices, eating behavior, and overcoming cognitive biases. The conclusions depict a promising way forward for the study of choice: an improved model for interpreting and overcoming human errors, due to changes in the contingencies of behavior.",The authors would like to thank Nicholas J.

62,Psychological risk factors and the course of depression and anxiety disorders: A review of 15 years of NESDA research,"Sascha Y Struijs, Peter J de Jong, Bertus F Jeronimus, Willem van der Does, Harriëtte Riese, Philip Spinhoven",Elsevier,2021-09-01,10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.086,pub.1140777750,"BACKGROUND: The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA; N<sub>baseline</sub>=2981) is an ongoing longitudinal, multi-site, naturalistic, cohort study examining the etiology, course, and consequences of depression and anxiety. In this article we synthesize and evaluate fifteen years of NESDA research on prominent psychological risk factors for the onset, persistence, recurrence, and comorbidity of affective disorders.
METHODS: A narrative review of 62 NESDA articles examining the specificity and predictive value of neuroticism, behavioral inhibition, repetitive negative thinking, experiential avoidance, cognitive reactivity, locus of control, (implicit) self-esteem, (implicit) disorder-specific self-associations, and attentional bias for the course of affective disorders.
RESULTS: All self-reported risk factors showed cross-sectional relationships with singular and comorbid affective disorders, and prospective relationships with the development and chronicity of depression and anxiety disorders. High neuroticism, low self-esteem, and negative repetitive thinking showed most prominent transdiagnostic relationships, whereas cognitive reactivity showed most pronounced depression-specific associations. Implicit self-esteem showed predictive validity for the persistence and recurrence of anxiety and depression over and above self-reported risk factors. Automatic approach-avoidance behavior and attentional bias for negative, positive, or threat words showed no relationship with affective disorders.
CONCLUSION: NESDA identified both (a) transdiagnostic factors (e.g., neuroticism, low implicit self-esteem, repetitive negative thinking) that may help explain the comorbidity between affective disorders and overlap in symptoms, and (b) indications for disorder-specific risk factors (e.g., cognitive responsivity) which support the relevance of distinct disorder categories and disorder-specific mechanisms. Thus, the results point to the relevance of both transdiagnostic and disorder-specific targets for therapeutic interventions.",None.,Journal of Affective Disorders,295,,1,"['Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Cohort Studies', 'Depression', 'Humans', 'Netherlands', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']","['pub.1023276458', 'pub.1010926018', 'pub.1039552612', 'pub.1138157250', 'pub.1053346139', 'pub.1012973908', 'pub.1044851528', 'pub.1034602255', 'pub.1014408630', 'pub.1004085175', 'pub.1011076933', 'pub.1047688983', 'pub.1002063116', 'pub.1002640983', 'pub.1024102957', 'pub.1011147610', 'pub.1040899824', 'pub.1032658116', 'pub.1073288245', 'pub.1037855198', 'pub.1033022522', 'pub.1019760435', 'pub.1135138633', 'pub.1124101740', 'pub.1111370477', 'pub.1022778459', 'pub.1042780125', 'pub.1106082023', 'pub.1063496702', 'pub.1022956770', 'pub.1047921084', 'pub.1042549366', 'pub.1072206264', 'pub.1120396269', 'pub.1113264704', 'pub.1023960249', 'pub.1109489541', 'pub.1037124498', 'pub.1034220746', 'pub.1038907965', 'pub.1019770990', 'pub.1084126570', 'pub.1051947869', 'pub.1042846228', 'pub.1035877332', 'pub.1053969483', 'pub.1101331789', 'pub.1021684622', 'pub.1044542608', 'pub.1053768758', 'pub.1039837279', 'pub.1005404321', 'pub.1010298860', 'pub.1030489563', 'pub.1069777102', 'pub.1044179467', 'pub.1016514681', 'pub.1008340850', 'pub.1090356022', 'pub.1005937886', 'pub.1008329888', 'pub.1039024938', 'pub.1104410700', 'pub.1003027650', 'pub.1053154733', 'pub.1019088751', 'pub.1111218880', 'pub.1041220868', 'pub.1016665063', 'pub.1120685259', 'pub.1013715548', 'pub.1040532662', 'pub.1104128845', 'pub.1016759909', 'pub.1043988689', 'pub.1067627952', 'pub.1011564622', 'pub.1020116088', 'pub.1072204786', 'pub.1006175383', 'pub.1018931155', 'pub.1053748123', 'pub.1113383751', 'pub.1039394527', 'pub.1037711189', 'pub.1014005463', 'pub.1029453923', 'pub.1049265354', 'pub.1111323786', 'pub.1051315009', 'pub.1090956745', 'pub.1107946190', 'pub.1063493903', 'pub.1103682383', 'pub.1038270740', 'pub.1030653166', 'pub.1033081581', 'pub.1053897130', 'pub.1008139876', 'pub.1009207601', 'pub.1043779094', 'pub.1130902785', 'pub.1045425245', 'pub.1085383627', 'pub.1084252902', 'pub.1103597973', 'pub.1000835619']"

To examine how cultural affective values might influence social media use, we developed a new sentiment analysis tool that allowed us to compare the affective content of Twitter posts in the United States (55,867 tweets, 1,888 users) and Japan (63,863 tweets, 1,825 users). Consistent with their respective cultural affective values, U.S. users primarily produced positive (vs. negative) posts, whereas Japanese users primarily produced low (vs. high) arousal posts. Contrary to cultural affective values, however, U.S. users were more influenced by changes in others' high arousal negative (e.g., angry) posts, whereas Japanese were more influenced by changes in others' high arousal positive (e.g., excited) posts. These patterns held after controlling for differences in baseline exposure to affective content, and across different topics. Together, these results suggest that across cultures, while social media users primarily produce content that supports their affective values, they are more influenced by content that violates those values. These findings have implications for theories about which affective content spreads on social media, and for applications related to the optimal design and use of social media platforms around the world.

65,What Arguments against COVID-19 Vaccines Run on Facebook in Poland: Content Analysis of Comments,"Dominik Wawrzuta, Mariusz Jaworski, Joanna Gotlib, Mariusz Panczyk",MDPI,2021-05-10,10.3390/vaccines9050481,pub.1137903816,"Social media allow anti-vaxxers to quickly spread misinformation and false statements. This situation may lead to an increase in vaccine hesitancy. We wanted to characterize what arguments against COVID-19 vaccines run on Facebook in Poland. We analyzed Facebook comments related to the five events of the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines-announcements of the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech (09.11.2020), Moderna (16.11.2020), and AstraZeneca (23.11.2020) vaccines, registration of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (21.12.2020), and the first vaccination in Poland (27.12.2020). We collected the comments from fanpages of the biggest Polish media and then established their main anti-vaccine themes. We found that the negative arguments about COVID-19 vaccines can be divided into 12 categories. Seven of them are universal and also apply to other vaccines but five are new and COVID-19' specific. The frequency of arguments from a given category varied over time. We also noticed that, while the comments were mostly negative, the reactions were positive. Created codebook of anti-vaccine COVID-19 arguments can be used to monitor the attitude of society towards COVID-19 vaccines. Real-time monitoring of social media is important because the popularity of certain arguments on Facebook changes rapidly over time.",We would like to thank Kamila Kraszewska for helping us categorize the comments.,Vaccines,9,5,8,,"['pub.1131878086', 'pub.1084822826', 'pub.1037880012', 'pub.1091432999', 'pub.1092563925', 'pub.1133344115', 'pub.1133368355', 'pub.1038622647', 'pub.1049988701', 'pub.1131095756', 'pub.1114071401', 'pub.1134685085', 'pub.1104510875', 'pub.1050332883', 'pub.1044104678', 'pub.1130072676', 'pub.1133083162', 'pub.1101622876', 'pub.1127233176', 'pub.1010472043', 'pub.1120912869', 'pub.1036409360', 'pub.1106342390', 'pub.1121091959', 'pub.1113711172', 'pub.1106186970', 'pub.1049703099', 'pub.1127234315', 'pub.1103662550', 'pub.1122698869', 'pub.1069286634', 'pub.1022179814', 'pub.1045112999', 'pub.1133438167', 'pub.1007695009', 'pub.1107721107', 'pub.1124097493', 'pub.1120706265', 'pub.1135785218', 'pub.1001670633', 'pub.1125116048', 'pub.1084169990', 'pub.1052148847', 'pub.1130153526', 'pub.1063722699']"

67,Revenge: A Multilevel Review and Synthesis,"Joshua Conrad Jackson, Virginia K Choi, Michele J Gelfand",Annual Reviews,2019-01-04,10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-103305,pub.1111099263,"Why do people take revenge? This question can be difficult to answer. Vengeance seems interpersonally destructive and antithetical to many of the most basic human instincts. However, an emerging body of social scientific research has begun to illustrate a logic to revenge, demonstrating why revenge evolved in humans and when and how people take revenge. We review this evidence and suggest that future studies on revenge would benefit from a multilevel perspective in which individual acts of revenge exist within higher-level cultural systems, with the potential to instigate change in these systems over time. With this framework, we can better understand the interplay between revenge's psychological properties and its role in cultural evolution.",,Annual Review of Psychology,70,1,51,"['Aggression', 'Biological Evolution', 'Conflict, Psychological', 'Cultural Evolution', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Social Behavior']","['pub.1072898778', 'pub.1072226116', 'pub.1020336336', 'pub.1008621801', 'pub.1028138602', 'pub.1051000046', 'pub.1092186841', 'pub.1022639704', 'pub.1009919491', 'pub.1010132564', 'pub.1047376435', 'pub.1017282027', 'pub.1004736511', 'pub.1064222277', 'pub.1011000490', 'pub.1045905975', 'pub.1002336189', 'pub.1002239467', 'pub.1023642739', 'pub.1003445752', 'pub.1042726880', 'pub.1063741213', 'pub.1060023879', 'pub.1019021967', 'pub.1017433455', 'pub.1053862239', 'pub.1099698917', 'pub.1048007973', 'pub.1046436625', 'pub.1058603265', 'pub.1012750897', 'pub.1026216365', 'pub.1040410075', 'pub.1030215681', 'pub.1026559737', 'pub.1049854797', 'pub.1026124884', 'pub.1109719965', 'pub.1090596771', 'pub.1063740213', 'pub.1012553060', 'pub.1017972204', 'pub.1098687292', 'pub.1003883361', 'pub.1014659923', 'pub.1023332928', 'pub.1064530934', 'pub.1024745287', 'pub.1060023689', 'pub.1013781598', 'pub.1039821720', 'pub.1007542973', 'pub.1027783347', 'pub.1063741204', 'pub.1035320809', 'pub.1024066627', 'pub.1000168545', 'pub.1104508733', 'pub.1007070768', 'pub.1007570082', 'pub.1036951312', 'pub.1011749055', 'pub.1037748413', 'pub.1011484048', 'pub.1009521193', 'pub.1030763771', 'pub.1067630429', 'pub.1029210152', 'pub.1013408412', 'pub.1102178671', 'pub.1090941910', 'pub.1013275994', 'pub.1038330958', 'pub.1000491370', 'pub.1007749277', 'pub.1014751539', 'pub.1003108700', 'pub.1008773276', 'pub.1029494632', 'pub.1037410392', 'pub.1111581489', 'pub.1029455854', 'pub.1049070529', 'pub.1023127193', 'pub.1030468040', 'pub.1046397075', 'pub.1064530071', 'pub.1027097483', 'pub.1091810228', 'pub.1070093850', 'pub.1051808406', 'pub.1021226817', 'pub.1008638123', 'pub.1029941575', 'pub.1053315482', 'pub.1063722333', 'pub.1002562988', 'pub.1034369469', 'pub.1029528966', 'pub.1063740660', 'pub.1090894459', 'pub.1048490521', 'pub.1028789360', 'pub.1042771926', 'pub.1049533645', 'pub.1013310488', 'pub.1034268568', 'pub.1018905261', 'pub.1135926636', 'pub.1032934102', 'pub.1030085964', 'pub.1063740490', 'pub.1000494866', 'pub.1085593526', 'pub.1022124113', 'pub.1007521565', 'pub.1063740018', 'pub.1001159194', 'pub.1092522036', 'pub.1044422344', 'pub.1046305947', 'pub.1040196774', 'pub.1012766368', 'pub.1084217030', 'pub.1000586156', 'pub.1022233554', 'pub.1084132187', 'pub.1042236587', 'pub.1036943982', 'pub.1046752077', 'pub.1038592395', 'pub.1026240605', 'pub.1042026501', 'pub.1034765436', 'pub.1043255192', 'pub.1020490997', 'pub.1067699863', 'pub.1024530169', 'pub.1042887031', 'pub.1008427748', 'pub.1083873135', 'pub.1024140328', 'pub.1071186734', 'pub.1008392680', 'pub.1091133200', 'pub.1008840833', 'pub.1056437408', 'pub.1041425931', 'pub.1053357206', 'pub.1100764689', 'pub.1024164290', 'pub.1019093559', 'pub.1085588294', 'pub.1010571817', 'pub.1019400951', 'pub.1004989076', 'pub.1052973679', 'pub.1033695802', 'pub.1084248139', 'pub.1001019967', 'pub.1111981078', 'pub.1054802256', 'pub.1032091215', 'pub.1003595646', 'pub.1065049153', 'pub.1052926007', 'pub.1007428009', 'pub.1047767950', 'pub.1029464288', 'pub.1029930053', 'pub.1051181761', 'pub.1037680862', 'pub.1017104472', 'pub.1008214863', 'pub.1025776165', 'pub.1043506433', 'pub.1012220726', 'pub.1021992984', 'pub.1059406986', 'pub.1037587052', 'pub.1092069695', 'pub.1035392273', 'pub.1022942490', 'pub.1023909551', 'pub.1050888940', 'pub.1098740655', 'pub.1064218742', 'pub.1044935752', 'pub.1063788039', 'pub.1033676720', 'pub.1037567652', 'pub.1045645543', 'pub.1039621902', 'pub.1053352994', 'pub.1033934945', 'pub.1012470749', 'pub.1009339882', 'pub.1034004013', 'pub.1091613068', 'pub.1050756185']"

After briefly introducing the field's intellectual foundations, we review recent basic research into the three core elements of decision making: judgment, or how people predict the outcomes that will follow possible choices; preference, or how people weigh those outcomes; and choice, or how people combine judgments and preferences to reach a decision. We then review research into two potential sources of behavioral heterogeneity: individual differences in decision-making competence and developmental changes across the life span. Next, we illustrate applications intended to improve individual and organizational decision making in health, public policy, intelligence analysis, and risk management. We emphasize the potential value of coupling analytical and behavioral research and having basic and applied research inform one another.",,Annual Review of Psychology,71,1,22,"['Decision Making', 'Human Development', 'Humans', 'Individuality', 'Judgment']","['pub.1021919324', 'pub.1112645905', 'pub.1037578427', 'pub.1015710580', 'pub.1016943030', 'pub.1050500567', 'pub.1022154806', 'pub.1064718107', 'pub.1016376127', 'pub.1001006997', 'pub.1098664904', 'pub.1050093849', 'pub.1005780643', 'pub.1069641248', 'pub.1041153045', 'pub.1084867200', 'pub.1023891594', 'pub.1003899127', 'pub.1034262612', 'pub.1025972247', 'pub.1017288207', 'pub.1053179849', 'pub.1007092497', 'pub.1034387809', 'pub.1026029414', 'pub.1058866809', 'pub.1037907637', 'pub.1028194139', 'pub.1044288761', 'pub.1033968904', 'pub.1051226296', 'pub.1108429669', 'pub.1062510354', 'pub.1022866746', 'pub.1048629053', 'pub.1098713315', 'pub.1052842397', 'pub.1064706281', 'pub.1061949391', 'pub.1064717589', 'pub.1030703648', 'pub.1048341256', 'pub.1042440585', 'pub.1025990057', 'pub.1005642761', 'pub.1028732851', 'pub.1105186124', 'pub.1020222966', 'pub.1085466996', 'pub.1048593104', 'pub.1085860130', 'pub.1005732865', 'pub.1062548425', 'pub.1105155225', 'pub.1043515952', 'pub.1041126222', 'pub.1022130974', 'pub.1002757294', 'pub.1011636522', 'pub.1025374871', 'pub.1024547231', 'pub.1051305005', 'pub.1028932341', 'pub.1011512154', 'pub.1064718271', 'pub.1047115578', 'pub.1084247816', 'pub.1061837439', 'pub.1021990982', 'pub.1098732006', 'pub.1046116692', 'pub.1064718314', 'pub.1001809392', 'pub.1036003027', 'pub.1079019535', 'pub.1024021074', 'pub.1025343004', 'pub.1044093389', 'pub.1108401488', 'pub.1010107880', 'pub.1019206593', 'pub.1108808609', 'pub.1024907104', 'pub.1033117351', 'pub.1048659631', 'pub.1095995799', 'pub.1063005728', 'pub.1050255305', 'pub.1069380487', 'pub.1045441451', 'pub.1111930784', 'pub.1092450033', 'pub.1092172894', 'pub.1079405866', 'pub.1030004361', 'pub.1026623352', 'pub.1014199156', 'pub.1004730473', 'pub.1092246971', 'pub.1022711716', 'pub.1099637589', 'pub.1062665356', 'pub.1099598868', 'pub.1092023288', 'pub.1100894555', 'pub.1083852749', 'pub.1048107048', 'pub.1109394232', 'pub.1014906764', 'pub.1006198584', 'pub.1025674786', 'pub.1013609189', 'pub.1092480414', 'pub.1099607298', 'pub.1111533620', 'pub.1047086090', 'pub.1029940648', 'pub.1004291944', 'pub.1027236253', 'pub.1022076472', 'pub.1064718259', 'pub.1030016915', 'pub.1064719719', 'pub.1109502871', 'pub.1004979878', 'pub.1101476368']"
69,Efficacy of a self-applied online program to promote resilience and coping skills in university students in four Spanish-speaking countries: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Araceli Palma-Gómez, Rocío Herrero, Rosa Baños, Azucena García-Palacios, Claudia Castañeiras, Gabriela Lidia Fernandez, Dario Martín Llull, Lorena Cudris Torres, Libia Alvis Barranco, Leonardo Cárdenas-Gómez, Cristina Botella",Springer Nature,2020-04-05,10.1186/s12888-020-02536-w,pub.1126152119,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence of a high prevalence of depression and anxiety in university students. Therefore, college time is a key period where prevention of mental disorders through interventions that promote resilience and mental health can be relevant. Currently, there are interventions available, but these are insufficient for those who need them. Online interventions are tools that can facilitate global accessibility and are easy for young people to use. CORE (Cultivating Our Resilience) is a self-administered online program, based on Ryff's psychological well-being model, to promote resilience and coping skills in university students at risk of developing symptoms of depression or anxiety. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention protocol in comparison with an active control condition targeting healthy lifestyle, and a waiting list control condition. The study will be conducted in four populations of Spanish-speaking university students (Spain, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico).
METHODS: The study design is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). At least 324 university students will be randomly assigned to three conditions: 1) CORE, a 6-week training program to improve resilience; 2) HLP, a 6-week training to promote a healthy lifestyle; and 3) WL, waiting list control condition. The primary outcome measure will be the Connor-Davidson resilience scale. Additionally, measures of anxiety, depression, quality of life and socio-demographic variables (age, sex, incomes, marital status, among others) will be collected. Participants will be evaluated at pre-treatment, after each module, 6 weeks after allocation, and at 3-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be performed.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study will contribute to research on Internet-administered interventions and the implementation of a protocol that includes a series of components designed to improve resilience and coping skills, increase psychological well-being, and prevent depression and anxiety disorders in Spanish-speaking university students. In addition, avenues will be opened up for new research on the effectiveness of these interventions focused on the prevention and promotion of mental health in Spanish-speaking countries.

72,Mapping Emoji Usage Among Youth,"Reena Shah, Ruchi Tewari",SAGE Publications,2021-01-21,10.1177/0973258620982541,pub.1134770109,"Emoji is now a popular inclusion in technology-mediated communication and a part of everyday expression of users. Yet, there is a dearth of scientifically designed research studies focussing on the human implications of the use of emojis. Limited systematic inquiry in this area is restricted to technical studies focussing on algorithm analysis of humongous quantitative data ignoring the people who are posting these emojis. Therefore, in the present study, an attempt is made to study the use of emojis from an individual’s behavioural perspective borrowing from the classic ‘contagion theory’ and the ‘information-signal theory’. A mixed research approach was adopted to study young university student’s emoji usage behaviour. Focus group discussion (FGD) was conducted on 11 participants with an average age of 22.5 years. The discussion was transcribed and thematic analysis was then conducted from which a survey instrument was developed which was administered to 250 university students. These survey data were then analysed using exploratory factor analysis. Results show that social media platforms, linguistic pattern, social relationships, emotional connect and level of formality and gender emerged as important factors that drive emoji usage. The findings of the study indicate the psychological implications and socio-behavioural impact of emoji usage which can be used for creating regulations and norms.

Difficulties properly regulating emotions are related to psychopathological processes.
OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the factor structure of the Brazilian version of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ); the invariance of its psychometric parameters as a function of gender; and its convergent validity with other scales measuring affective processes.
METHOD: A total of 813 adults (73.7% women), aged between 18 and 64 years and with a high educational level used an electronic platform to complete the ERQ, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Affect Scale (AS), and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Factor structure, reliability, and validity of the adapted version of the ERQ were investigated.
RESULTS: Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) revealed adequate goodness of fit for the ERQ's two-factor model (cognitive reappraisal and emotional suppression), providing evidence of invariance of its psychometric parameters as a function of gender. Correlations between the ERQ's factors and measures of affect and emotional dysregulation presented positive indicators, with significant associations between emotion regulation and affective experiences depending on gender.
CONCLUSION: The ERQ presents good psychometric indicators for use with the Brazilian population.",The first author would like to thank Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) for the PhD scholarship (Finance Code 001).

Dunlop, Carmen Lawrence",Elsevier,2019-01-29,10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.01.038,pub.1111749369,"RATIONALE: Childhood vaccination is a safe and effective way of reducing infectious diseases. Yet, public confidence in vaccination is waning, driven in part by the 'manufacture of doubt' by anti-vaccination activists and websites. However, there is little research examining the psychological underpinnings of anti-vaccination rhetoric among parents.
OBJECTIVES: Here, we examined the structure and moral roots of anti-vaccination attitudes amongst Australian parents active on social media parenting sites.
METHODS: Participants (N = 296) completed questionnaires assessing their vaccination attitudes, behavioural intentions, and moral preferences.
RESULTS: Using Latent Profile Analysis, we identified three profiles (i.e., groups), interpretable as vaccine ""accepters"", ""fence sitters"", and ""rejecters"", each characterised by a distinct pattern of vaccination attitudes and moral preferences. Accepters exhibited positive vaccination attitudes and strong intentions to vaccinate; rejecters exhibited the opposite pattern of responses; whilst fence sitters exhibited an intermediate pattern of responses. Compared to accepters, rejecters and fence sitters exhibited a heightened moral preference for liberty (belief in the rights of the individual) and harm (concern about the wellbeing of others). Compared to acceptors and fence sitters, rejecters exhibited a heightened moral preference for purity (an abhorrence for impurity of body), and a diminished moral preference for authority (deference to those in positions of power).
CONCLUSION: Given the sensitivity of fence sitters and rejecters to liberty-related moral concerns, our research cautions against the use of adversarial approaches-e.g., No Jab, No Pay legislation-that promote vaccination uptake by restricting parental freedoms, as they may backfire amongst parents ambivalent toward vaccination.",,Social Science & Medicine,224,,29,"['Adult', 'Australia', 'Child', 'Female', 'Freedom', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Intention', 'Male', 'Morals', 'Parents', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vaccination']","['pub.1030718029', 'pub.1018277659', 'pub.1052517587', 'pub.1035826236', 'pub.1006145917', 'pub.1037161891', 'pub.1062469079', 'pub.1040419471', 'pub.1032091039', 'pub.1024384213', 'pub.1049988701', 'pub.1068264450', 'pub.1020278637', 'pub.1037284961', 'pub.1030600254', 'pub.1020576313', 'pub.1003815233', 'pub.1058854377', 'pub.1085464393', 'pub.1024172235', 'pub.1021109724', 'pub.1098742099', 'pub.1043487017', 'pub.1105100355', 'pub.1014830037', 'pub.1072304795', 'pub.1105831703', 'pub.1046995534', 'pub.1034266650', 'pub.1021172572']"

Here we study the possible impact of long-term mental training in socio-affective capacities such as compassion on altruistic punishment and compensatory behavior in economic games. To this end we recruited a group of long-term meditation practitioners (LTPs) who had engaged in an average of 40 K h of mental training exercises including compassion-related meditation, along with a group of meditation-naïve controls. Participants played several adaptations of the dictator game in which they had the opportunity to punish the dictator both when they were the recipients of the dictator's offer and when they were third-party witnesses to the dictator's treatment of an anonymous second player. Compared to controls, LTPs were less likely to punish when they were the victims of fairness violations. However, both groups punished equivalently when they witnessed others receiving unfair treatment. In post-task questionnaires, controls reported significantly more anger in response to unfair offers than LTPs, although fairness judgments did not differ between groups. These data suggest that because the LTPs were less angered by unfair treatment of themselves, they punished that behavior less. However, when they witnessed the unfair treatment of others, they engaged in norm-reinforcing punishment. Finally, when participants played an additional game which included the opportunity to recompense victims, LTPs were more likely to do so. Together these data point to differential approaches to justice whereby LTPs engaged less in vengeful, retributive justice and focused more on norm reinforcement and the restoration of equity. These differences suggest that social preferences are plastic and that altruistic responses to unfairness may be shaped by the prolonged cultivation of prosocial motivation, altruism, and compassion.

However, the use of the term's 'prisoner' or 'prisoners' remains common. Although less common, terms such as 'offenders' and 'inmates' are also still used on occasion. This persists despite calls from people with lived experience of incarceration, and fellow academics, to stop using these terms. Given the considerable overlap between substance use, infectious diseases, and incarceration, in this commentary we discuss how they interact, including the stigma that is common to each. We propose that using person-centred language (i.e., people in prison or people formerly in prison) needs to become the default language used when presenting research related to people in prison or people formerly in prison. This is a much-needed step in efforts to overcome the continued stigma that people in prison face while incarcerated from prison officers and other employees, including healthcare providers. Likewise, overcoming stigma, including legalised discrimination, that follows people who were formerly in prison upon gaining their freedom is critical, as this impacts their health and related social determinants, including employment and housing.","The authors wish to thank the numerous people with lived experience of incarceration who have candidly and bravely shared their experiences of prison and their thoughts about how language choices matter for people in prison and people formerly in prison.

Marcelin",Springer Nature,2021-08-27,10.1007/s11908-021-00758-x,pub.1140703992,"Purpose of Review: The purpose of this study is to review racial and ethnic inequities in the incidence and prevention of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the USA, identify gaps in the literature, and recommend future directions to mitigate these inequities.
Recent Findings: While some existing literature has identified the presence of racial/ethnic inequities in HAI incidence and outcomes, few studies to date have evaluated whether HAI prevention efforts have mitigated these inequities. Factors contributing to inequities in HAI prevention may include unconscious bias of healthcare professionals towards minoritized patients; socioeconomic and structural inequities disparately affecting minoritized communities; the racial segregation of quality healthcare through hospital price discrimination; divergent reimbursement rates between public and private insurers; policies or performance metrics which underfund and financially penalize safety-net hospitals; and insufficient research evaluating and addressing HAI inequities.
Summary: Expansion of the literature is needed to further interrogate root causes and evaluate the impact of interventions on racial/ethnic inequities in HAI incidence. Measures to mitigate inequities might include teaching healthcare workers how to recognize and mitigate unconscious biases, expanding community resources which address the social and structural determinants of health, increasing access to preventive health services, reforming federal and institutional policies to better support safety-net hospitals and disincentivize price discrimination, and improving diversity and inclusion within the health workforce.",,Current Infectious Disease Reports,23,10,1,,"['pub.1039182333', 'pub.1003190091', 'pub.1124228334', 'pub.1034483660', 'pub.1132249569', 'pub.1030878829', 'pub.1048263376', 'pub.1132384057', 'pub.1068847300', 'pub.1133568870', 'pub.1103323960', 'pub.1054605075', 'pub.1111256094', 'pub.1122930453', 'pub.1011011892', 'pub.1034848928', 'pub.1083871321', 'pub.1130244081', 'pub.1131159100', 'pub.1020343935', 'pub.1002054464', 'pub.1130550725', 'pub.1033943403', 'pub.1101888222', 'pub.1124333480', 'pub.1036411622', 'pub.1105167377', 'pub.1041531334', 'pub.1117478722', 'pub.1117186963', 'pub.1101107614', 'pub.1084040514', 'pub.1133588955', 'pub.1135025283', 'pub.1128218186', 'pub.1133321260', 'pub.1120843719', 'pub.1074236506', 'pub.1045817871', 'pub.1042543963', 'pub.1122866871', 'pub.1026667073', 'pub.1129074173', 'pub.1117291629', 'pub.1068877856']"
88,What Is Influencer Marketing and How Does It Target Children? A Review and Direction for Future Research,"Marijke De Veirman, Liselot Hudders, Michelle R. Nelson",Frontiers,2019-12-03,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02685,pub.1123089043,"Children nowadays spend many hours online watching YouTube videos in which their favorite vloggers are playing games, unboxing toys, reviewing products, making jokes or just going about their daily activities. These vloggers regularly post attractive and entertaining content in the hope of building a large follower base. Although many of these vloggers are adults, the number of child vloggers is flourishing. The famous child vlogger Ryan of Ryan's World, for instance, has more than 19 million viewers and he is (at age seven) a social media influencer. The popularity of these vloggers incited advertisers to include them as a new marketing communication tool, also referred to as influencer marketing, in their marketing strategy. Accordingly, many influential vloggers now receive free products from brands in return for a mention in one of their videos and their other social media (e.g., TikTok or Instagram) and some are even paid to create a sponsored post or video and distribute it to their followers. This sponsored content appears to be highly influential and may affect young children's brand preferences. Given the limited advertising literacy skills (i.e., knowledge of advertising and skills to critically reflect on this advertising) of children under age 12, they are a vulnerable target group when it comes to persuasion. Therefore, caution is needed when implementing this marketing tactic to target them. However, research on how influencer marketing affects young children (under 12) is scarce and it is unclear how these young children can be empowered to critically cope with this fairly new form of persuasion. This paper therefore aims to shed light on why and how social media influencers have persuasive power over their young followers. The paper starts with providing insights into how and why social media influencers became a new source in advertising. We then discuss the few studies that have been conducted on influencer marketing among young children (under 12), based on a systematic literature review, and take these findings to formulate societal and policy implications and develop a future research agenda.",,Frontiers in Psychology,10,,45,,"['pub.1024777255', 'pub.1006645134', 'pub.1100423801', 'pub.1069756543', 'pub.1092278311', 'pub.1117868058', 'pub.1013222972', 'pub.1070861559', 'pub.1004730593', 'pub.1004968270', 'pub.1048461163', 'pub.1090718118', 'pub.1012496325', 'pub.1120169961', 'pub.1069380098', 'pub.1041115172', 'pub.1017550641', 'pub.1029407369', 'pub.1011974278', 'pub.1085260060', 'pub.1105919738', 'pub.1084159557', 'pub.1044047000', 'pub.1058577609', 'pub.1030013480', 'pub.1054789792', 'pub.1058528804', 'pub.1005205402', 'pub.1006093381', 'pub.1008954080', 'pub.1038397438', 'pub.1039803300', 'pub.1111642143', 'pub.1024452333', 'pub.1040027725', 'pub.1045660707', 'pub.1004279882', 'pub.1003739147', 'pub.1030922375', 'pub.1115598518', 'pub.1059247243', 'pub.1107927647', 'pub.1117071631', 'pub.1117695754', 'pub.1069382457', 'pub.1106958955', 'pub.1085020050', 'pub.1011029948', 'pub.1047463831', 'pub.1036419557', 'pub.1007024214', 'pub.1023546944', 'pub.1116854051', 'pub.1003135249', 'pub.1002158096', 'pub.1034392088', 'pub.1112530947', 'pub.1058528616', 'pub.1091868289', 'pub.1104434613', 'pub.1115538647', 'pub.1037233802', 'pub.1099919514', 'pub.1013030196', 'pub.1008733887', 'pub.1084159476', 'pub.1070862866', 'pub.1051420133', 'pub.1105701663', 'pub.1043286273', 'pub.1109617664', 'pub.1028288012', 'pub.1046488359', 'pub.1034972821', 'pub.1045087903', 'pub.1000189938', 'pub.1036842365', 'pub.1090972244', 'pub.1045906237', 'pub.1053674869', 'pub.1031384760', 'pub.1018988746', 'pub.1013429194', 'pub.1013192793', 'pub.1021711363', 'pub.1031107056', 'pub.1101119800', 'pub.1058579066', 'pub.1043908800', 'pub.1044786877', 'pub.1046828240', 'pub.1011717658', 'pub.1058528967', 'pub.1011279757', 'pub.1010449058', 'pub.1086049997', 'pub.1111666284', 'pub.1003505827', 'pub.1063983242', 'pub.1084159510', 'pub.1050123349']"

Data from the National Health Fund, Central Statistical Office, National Register of Geographic Names and OpenStreetMap were used in the research. The research was carried out on the basis of modelled distance from the rural statistical localities to the nearest PHC facility. The methods used included network analysis, characteristics of normal point distribution, Theil index, and spatial autocorrelation. Areas where the greatest shortages of access to PHC facilities occurred were indicated on the basis of the analysis of their clustering density. The average distance from rural statistical localities in Poland to PHC facilities is about 5 km. Slightly more than 70% of the distance values are within one standard deviation of the mean. Better access to the examined healthcare facilities is available in the southern and central parts of Poland, while northern and eastern Poland, as well as the border areas, suffer from lower accessibility. Poor access to PHC occurs first of all at the border of Greater Poland Voivodeship with the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, on the border of the Lodz Voivodeship, in Masovian and Swietokrzyskie Voivodeship, and in the ring surrounding Warsaw, as well as in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

On the three bus lines in the control condition, there was no such message on the card holders. Analysis of the number of rides per hour showed that the intervention led to a change from pre-intervention (619 days) to post-intervention period (176 days) that was estimated to be 1.18 rides per day greater on experimental lines than on control lines.

Based on the functionalist and evolutionary perspective on emotions, we hypothesized that the association between negative emotions and BP is U-shaped, i.e., that both very high levels of negative emotions and the absence thereof are related to high BP.MethodsData from 7479 British civil servants who participated in Phases 1–11 (years 1985–2013) of the Whitehall II cohort study was used. Negative emotions were operationalized as negative affect and depressive and anxiety symptoms. Negative affect was measured at Phases 1 and 2. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at each phase. BP was measured at every other phase. For each negative emotion measure, an average across all phases was computed and used as a predictor of PB levels throughout the follow-up period using growth curve models.ResultsVery high values of anxiety and depressive symptoms, but not negative affect, were associated with higher levels of systolic BP. However, low to moderate levels of all negative emotions were associated with lower blood pressure than the absence of negative emotions.ConclusionsThe article offers a theoretical explanation for a previously observed inverse association between negative emotions and blood pressure and underscores that moderate levels of negative emotions that naturally occur in everyday life are not associated with risks of heightened blood pressure.",,International Journal of Behavioral Medicine,27,2,3,"['Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cohort Studies', 'Depression', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']","['pub.1056341292', 'pub.1033199931', 'pub.1050602030', 'pub.1005079709', 'pub.1053952162', 'pub.1017453947', 'pub.1003230075', 'pub.1052278949', 'pub.1043511160', 'pub.1037738021', 'pub.1084744430', 'pub.1043095051', 'pub.1044689941', 'pub.1050903848', 'pub.1085426952', 'pub.1047222024', 'pub.1045583915', 'pub.1032532205', 'pub.1011113910', 'pub.1034517366', 'pub.1010356607', 'pub.1108427146', 'pub.1042422590', 'pub.1003990159', 'pub.1061834261', 'pub.1031225072', 'pub.1003900709', 'pub.1039495684', 'pub.1030188200', 'pub.1007456321', 'pub.1041809009', 'pub.1022572738', 'pub.1044778899', 'pub.1007835004', 'pub.1082305919']"

Specifically, on the basis of the prescriptive stereotype held by those higher in racial bias-that Black (as compared to White) negotiators deserve lower salaries-we predicted that Black negotiators who behave in counterstereotypical ways encounter greater resistance and more unfavorable outcomes from more biased evaluators. We tested this argument in a stepwise fashion: In Study 1, we found that more biased evaluators expect Black job seekers to negotiate less as compared to White job seekers. When Black negotiators violate those expectations, evaluators award them lower starting salaries (Study 2), which appears to occur because evaluators become more resistant to making concessions to Black than to White job seekers (Study 3). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that racially biased perceptual distortions can be used to justify the provision of smaller monetary awards for Black job seekers in negotiations.

For this reason, it is necessary to extend the knowledge of predictors of prosocial behavior so that they can be transferred to teaching practice. The research reported here was carried out using a quantitative methodology through a survey, based on data collection instruments, whose data were treated statistically by means of descriptive, correlational and predictive analyses. The results obtained suggest that emotional intelligence has a strong predictive capacity for prosocial behavior while executive functions show a mild-moderate predictive behavior.

We hypothesized that an ability to contemplate alternatives to perceptions of the current environment, i.e., flexibility in perspective shifting, may be essential to both dispositions. Dispositional shame may additionally relate to negative relational knowledge that involves a self-representation of being rejected. One hundred and six community participants rated the two dispositions, and had their flexibility in perspective shifting and internalized self-association with rejection assessed. Regression analysis indicated that a lower cost of perspective shifting was observed with dispositional guilt and shame. Yet, unlike a direct association with perspective shifting for dispositional guilt, it was an interaction between perspective shifting and negative relational knowledge that accounted for dispositional shame. The association of dispositional shame with perspective shifting was contingent upon the tendency to pair the self with rejection.",,Consciousness and Cognition,92,,1,"['Emotions', 'Guilt', 'Humans', 'Personality', 'Shame']","['pub.1063741056', 'pub.1061935910', 'pub.1005773151', 'pub.1085986551', 'pub.1056368367', 'pub.1085059930', 'pub.1015976871', 'pub.1020957241', 'pub.1020337558', 'pub.1045547448', 'pub.1105761252', 'pub.1034135275', 'pub.1028241812', 'pub.1113703464', 'pub.1008853223', 'pub.1056396605', 'pub.1138362214', 'pub.1021070103', 'pub.1043192367', 'pub.1047486312', 'pub.1004510104', 'pub.1011002240', 'pub.1029811318', 'pub.1002752064', 'pub.1020370242', 'pub.1030376819', 'pub.1030882087', 'pub.1046087698', 'pub.1047437569', 'pub.1043790896', 'pub.1135462034', 'pub.1003641546', 'pub.1073308954', 'pub.1030350246', 'pub.1019543365', 'pub.1007653299', 'pub.1008521336', 'pub.1004612955', 'pub.1022163933', 'pub.1021702952', 'pub.1040483485', 'pub.1050244113', 'pub.1046754447', 'pub.1036371186', 'pub.1013173720', 'pub.1043042476', 'pub.1103842097', 'pub.1027935179', 'pub.1031900491', 'pub.1035352333', 'pub.1004709821', 'pub.1010926018', 'pub.1041461240', 'pub.1025106030', 'pub.1036527898', 'pub.1052793432', 'pub.1050424819', 'pub.1121664722', 'pub.1103659025', 'pub.1013037932', 'pub.1022957661', 'pub.1004473261', 'pub.1001536175', 'pub.1044824241', 'pub.1050632111', 'pub.1010606852', 'pub.1009843166', 'pub.1011729725', 'pub.1004794430', 'pub.1050951134', 'pub.1033670032']"

We investigated these relationships at both the student- and class-level because little is known about whether students' motivation-related perceptions vary across mathematics courses and whether this variance is related to overall class ratings of instruction. The sample included 795 students nested within 43 different mathematics course sections. Students provided their course perceptions of autonomy, utility value, expectancies for success, situational interest, instructor caring, expected grade, and their overall perceptions of the course and instructor. Multilevel modeling techniques were used to investigate potential student- and class-level effects as well as compositional effects. Students' class perceptions varied significantly across mathematics courses. In addition, students' motivation-related course perceptions were positively related to their instructor and course ratings at both the student-level and class-level; however, the strength of these relationships sometimes varied across courses for some of the motivation-related perceptions. These results suggest that the motivational climate (i.e., the psychological environment) can affect students' instructor and course ratings. Moreover, these findings suggest that instructors have some control over their instructor and course ratings through the teaching strategies that they implement. For example, they may be able to increase their ratings by implementing teaching strategies that support students' autonomy, goals, success, interests, and relationships.",The authors would like to thank Virginia Tech’s Open Access Subvention Fund and the Office of Assessment and Institutional Research at Virginia Military Institute for paying in part the publication fees for this manuscript.,Frontiers in Psychology,12,,3,,"['pub.1002770033', 'pub.1110582592', 'pub.1016569288', 'pub.1033215637', 'pub.1109742008', 'pub.1037715156', 'pub.1052203721', 'pub.1127575785', 'pub.1050489537', 'pub.1031441689', 'pub.1003570154', 'pub.1070967545', 'pub.1058784733', 'pub.1043487853', 'pub.1051071171', 'pub.1083918085', 'pub.1035877499', 'pub.1037366954', 'pub.1070668056', 'pub.1068780278', 'pub.1007308490', 'pub.1018052860', 'pub.1069757152', 'pub.1085242788', 'pub.1036327651', 'pub.1036668785', 'pub.1131066812', 'pub.1025634745', 'pub.1025493875', 'pub.1124480594', 'pub.1043619067', 'pub.1086105817', 'pub.1120695012', 'pub.1039067812', 'pub.1033783418', 'pub.1045694073', 'pub.1067208682', 'pub.1009742546', 'pub.1087281921', 'pub.1098662869', 'pub.1004729886', 'pub.1023541708', 'pub.1100774659', 'pub.1039745876', 'pub.1021572264', 'pub.1018675419', 'pub.1004614821', 'pub.1064096356', 'pub.1000274057', 'pub.1021477030', 'pub.1010758257', 'pub.1101014464', 'pub.1111945455', 'pub.1043401280', 'pub.1023533340', 'pub.1019773583', 'pub.1000415258', 'pub.1001357464', 'pub.1021473537', 'pub.1001789671', 'pub.1037881140', 'pub.1002024515', 'pub.1124831610', 'pub.1043303664', 'pub.1022858190', 'pub.1023091399', 'pub.1044649820', 'pub.1020656848', 'pub.1127381924', 'pub.1070668107', 'pub.1078344832', 'pub.1017576039', 'pub.1070970685', 'pub.1023339116', 'pub.1039901183', 'pub.1048681829', 'pub.1021062006', 'pub.1019261893', 'pub.1078344821', 'pub.1004732624', 'pub.1045380913']"

99,Sustainability of Publicly Funded Health Care Systems: What Does Behavioural Economics Offer?,"Luke B. Connelly, Stephen Birch",Springer Nature,2020-09-08,10.1007/s40273-020-00955-x,pub.1130663641,"There has been a rapid increase in the use of behavioural economics (BE) as a tool for policy makers to deploy, including in health-related applications. While this development has occurred over the past decade, health care systems have continued to struggle with escalating costs. We consider the potential role of BE for making improvements to health care system performance and the sustainability of publicly funded health care systems, in particular. We argue that the vast majority of applications in this field have been largely focussed on BE and public health, or the prevailing level of risks to health in populations, and with policy proposals to ‘nudge’ individual behaviour (e.g. in respect of dietary choices). Yet, improvements in population health may have little, if any, impact on the size, cost or efficiency of health care systems. Few applications of BE have focussed on the management, production, delivery or utilisation of health care services per se. The latter is our focus in this paper. We review the contributions on BE and health care and consider the potential for complementing the considerable work on BE and public health with a clear agenda for behavioural health care economics. This agenda should complement the work of conventional microeconomics in the health care sector.",,PharmacoEconomics,38,12,1,"['Administrative Personnel', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Economics, Behavioral', 'Health Services', 'Humans']","['pub.1041440170', 'pub.1062510354', 'pub.1033438224', 'pub.1018851043', 'pub.1001864292', 'pub.1020345681', 'pub.1039009824', 'pub.1003438715', 'pub.1018221975', 'pub.1121432925', 'pub.1058575214', 'pub.1084032093', 'pub.1128294577', 'pub.1028062931', 'pub.1032864989', 'pub.1017106468', 'pub.1007169220', 'pub.1051776826', 'pub.1101974337', 'pub.1045812453', 'pub.1012229030', 'pub.1008913974', 'pub.1064524079', 'pub.1024179874', 'pub.1022507923', 'pub.1028423377', 'pub.1030569487', 'pub.1017626216', 'pub.1085546565', 'pub.1005096963']"
100,Duchenne Smiles as Honest Signals of Chronic Positive Mood,"Kennon M. Sheldon, Mike Corcoran, Melanie Sheldon",SAGE Publications,2021-02-12,10.1177/1745691620959831,pub.1135388231,"Chronic positive mood (CPM) has been shown to confer a wide variety of social, functional, and health benefits. Some researchers have argued that humans evolved to feel CPM, which explains why most people report better than neutral mood (the ""positivity offset bias"") and why particularly happy people have particularly good outcomes. Here, we argue that the Duchenne smile evolved as an honest signal of high levels of CPM, alerting others to the psychological fitness of the smiler. Duchenne smiles are honest because they express felt positive emotion, making it difficult for unhappy people to produce them. Duchenne smiles enable happy people to signal and cooperate with one another, boosting their advantages. In our literature review, we found (a) that not all Duchenne smiles are ""honest,"" although producing them in the absence of positive emotion is difficult and often detectable, and (b) that the ability to produce and recognize Duchenne smiles may vary somewhat by a person's cultural origin. In the final section of the article, we consider behavioral influences on CPM, reviewing research showing that engaging in eudaimonic activity reliably produces CPM, as posited by the eudaimonic-activity model. This research suggests that frequent Duchenne smiling may ultimately signal eudaimonic personality as well as CPM.",,Perspectives on Psychological Science,16,3,3,"['Affect', 'Emotions', 'Humans', 'Personality', 'Smiling']","['pub.1103785860', 'pub.1026609789', 'pub.1002371740', 'pub.1045040780', 'pub.1050813650', 'pub.1036165957', 'pub.1045435604', 'pub.1001653407', 'pub.1018678498', 'pub.1023994449', 'pub.1029177182', 'pub.1111204267', 'pub.1047780085', 'pub.1063741200', 'pub.1047754276', 'pub.1111222494', 'pub.1092657107', 'pub.1036193001', 'pub.1061834170', 'pub.1025067432', 'pub.1130082439', 'pub.1034113813', 'pub.1038849639', 'pub.1053237068', 'pub.1022044258', 'pub.1048811693', 'pub.1036121962', 'pub.1014753815', 'pub.1084611254', 'pub.1048168770', 'pub.1008566569', 'pub.1034211710', 'pub.1090924671', 'pub.1024580403', 'pub.1101557618', 'pub.1006974039', 'pub.1029021824', 'pub.1020716656', 'pub.1026943850', 'pub.1042068128', 'pub.1056347274', 'pub.1019305995', 'pub.1024664718', 'pub.1122394520', 'pub.1015634230', 'pub.1040342895', 'pub.1040054414', 'pub.1062646865', 'pub.1033088157', 'pub.1005005641', 'pub.1039973937', 'pub.1050053928', 'pub.1121933782', 'pub.1001697523', 'pub.1041380775', 'pub.1108519299', 'pub.1019205555', 'pub.1104606648', 'pub.1032139292', 'pub.1050429772', 'pub.1030127212', 'pub.1024397499', 'pub.1010134296', 'pub.1025990279', 'pub.1104216171', 'pub.1070862117', 'pub.1019881738', 'pub.1027477580', 'pub.1012058399', 'pub.1020076420', 'pub.1022198922', 'pub.1040344617', 'pub.1044457044', 'pub.1005073989', 'pub.1003664752', 'pub.1040819543', 'pub.1019122261', 'pub.1041818981', 'pub.1025264197', 'pub.1038022044', 'pub.1051677343', 'pub.1049870327', 'pub.1020251093']"
101,Dispositional mindfulness is predicted by structural development of the insula during late adolescence,"S. Friedel, S.L. Whittle, N. Vijayakumar, J.G. Simmons, M.L. Byrne, O.S. Schwartz, N.B. Allen",Elsevier,2015-07-09,10.1016/j.dcn.2015.07.001,pub.1045826225,"Adolescence is a critical period of development, in which the increasing social and cognitive demands of independence need to be met by enhanced self-regulatory abilities. The cultivation of mindfulness has been associated with improved self-regulation in adult populations, and it is theorized that one neurodevelopmental mechanism that supports this capacity is the development of the prefrontal cortex. The current study examined the neurodevelopmental mechanisms associated with dispositional mindfulness in adolescence. Using a longitudinal within-persons design, 82 participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments at approximately ages 16 and 19, and also completed self-reported measurements of mindfulness at age 19. It was hypothesized that adolescents who demonstrated greater thinning of frontal cortical regions between the age of 16 and 19 would exhibit higher dispositional mindfulness levels at age 19. Results indicated that, contrary to predictions, adolescents with higher levels of mindfulness demonstrated less thinning in the left anterior insula. By contrast, higher IQ was associated with greater thinning of the right caudal middle frontal and right superior frontal regions. The involvement of insula development in mindfulness is consistent with a direct role for this structure in managing self-regulation, and in doing so concords with recent models of self-referential interoceptive awareness.

Using a sample of 892 secondary school students, this study aims to explore the criminogenic risk factors of juvenile delinquency in Hong Kong adolescents. Grounded in the theoretical propositions of mainstream criminological theories (i.e., self-control, social control, social learning, general strain, and routine activity), the adolescents' types of delinquent behavior (i.e., violent, nonviolent, and general delinquency) are examined. Findings indicate that male adolescents reported significantly higher levels of violent, nonviolent, and general delinquency than female adolescents. Relative to females, males are also reported significantly higher levels of pro-violence attitudes, deviant peer influence, alcohol and drug use, and perceived neighborhood disorganization. However, female adolescents are found to have higher levels of self-control, social bonding, and negative temperament than their male counterparts. Multivariate analyses demonstrate that deviant peer influence in addition to alcohol and drug use is found to be general risk factors for engaging in all sorts of delinquent activity. A high level of pro-violence attitudes is significantly associated with violent offending, while low self-control is a significant predictor of nonviolent offending and general delinquency. Social bonding, negative temperament, and perceived neighborhood disorganization are found to be important factors associated with general delinquency. Implications of the findings are offered to address the adolescents' criminogenic risk factors and prevent their propensity to engage in violent, nonviolent, and general delinquency.",,International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology,65,9,6,"['Adolescent', 'Aggression', 'Female', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Juvenile Delinquency', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Violence']","['pub.1009237619', 'pub.1063859992', 'pub.1007214421', 'pub.1000248973', 'pub.1043276895', 'pub.1069758233', 'pub.1053983125', 'pub.1003900715', 'pub.1040007052', 'pub.1029636182', 'pub.1049467483', 'pub.1120490803', 'pub.1042759766', 'pub.1040692620', 'pub.1046764819', 'pub.1042448140', 'pub.1003802690', 'pub.1001594517', 'pub.1024686524', 'pub.1026773978', 'pub.1069756540', 'pub.1012439687', 'pub.1063923581', 'pub.1009975319', 'pub.1067696792', 'pub.1046465184', 'pub.1010978252', 'pub.1017507557', 'pub.1110781218', 'pub.1050780502', 'pub.1031843947', 'pub.1006846271', 'pub.1022444314', 'pub.1025318208', 'pub.1031438888', 'pub.1007280692', 'pub.1027413393', 'pub.1020125857', 'pub.1041058596', 'pub.1052006203', 'pub.1098668297', 'pub.1036299843', 'pub.1043563979', 'pub.1008494499', 'pub.1014145357', 'pub.1021294743', 'pub.1019211026', 'pub.1041362489', 'pub.1077481864', 'pub.1025412022', 'pub.1016422181', 'pub.1011499710', 'pub.1050773412', 'pub.1113235932', 'pub.1036623632', 'pub.1035333819', 'pub.1027464489', 'pub.1041317330', 'pub.1063569921', 'pub.1024882312', 'pub.1032897363', 'pub.1051332623', 'pub.1030972006', 'pub.1032291465', 'pub.1049211015', 'pub.1014737016', 'pub.1026369168', 'pub.1002920314', 'pub.1024260615']"

I also discuss the consequences of discrimination against immigrants for immigrants themselves, their families, and the societies in which they settle. I conclude by presenting key research questions and topics in this domain that should be at the top of the research agenda for those interested in intergroup relations in this age of mass migration.",,Annual Review of Psychology,72,1,22,"['Attitude', 'Emigrants and Immigrants', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prejudice', 'Racism']","['pub.1038416069', 'pub.1021707423', 'pub.1063601454', 'pub.1039035549', 'pub.1023790527', 'pub.1032368165', 'pub.1085546916', 'pub.1036206806', 'pub.1064532120', 'pub.1114542291', 'pub.1024680470', 'pub.1009874618', 'pub.1008249463', 'pub.1032724390', 'pub.1102339232', 'pub.1013000592', 'pub.1046516664', 'pub.1088040162', 'pub.1019046746', 'pub.1125146048', 'pub.1012691765', 'pub.1104308059', 'pub.1052854260', 'pub.1034174635', 'pub.1012479304', 'pub.1015470976', 'pub.1019467632', 'pub.1028917559', 'pub.1105984171', 'pub.1037853185', 'pub.1010521386', 'pub.1053167221', 'pub.1059572881', 'pub.1091352081', 'pub.1003829776', 'pub.1020595088', 'pub.1117491259', 'pub.1038310709', 'pub.1049005423', 'pub.1033271200', 'pub.1044899345', 'pub.1036348756', 'pub.1056347728', 'pub.1104305268', 'pub.1041437044', 'pub.1009532253', 'pub.1007988193', 'pub.1022502133', 'pub.1059827748', 'pub.1026299987', 'pub.1068844686', 'pub.1021308770', 'pub.1113510361', 'pub.1113616222', 'pub.1023760597', 'pub.1062668350', 'pub.1053772129', 'pub.1112871313', 'pub.1059679558', 'pub.1019548419', 'pub.1030200181', 'pub.1000518119', 'pub.1053515041', 'pub.1012211556', 'pub.1052749698', 'pub.1026521145', 'pub.1001585187', 'pub.1034901373', 'pub.1005293535', 'pub.1007470716', 'pub.1033993152', 'pub.1022290587', 'pub.1089416534', 'pub.1120938331', 'pub.1033449532', 'pub.1040265964', 'pub.1004824430', 'pub.1020146083', 'pub.1064222269', 'pub.1025556584', 'pub.1122796197', 'pub.1007626731', 'pub.1007948655', 'pub.1101207563', 'pub.1071225898', 'pub.1015497124', 'pub.1018296983', 'pub.1047707962', 'pub.1108560271', 'pub.1129545683', 'pub.1112116155', 'pub.1009074355', 'pub.1013374211', 'pub.1068843306', 'pub.1100146750', 'pub.1027682136', 'pub.1045059917', 'pub.1093056757', 'pub.1114021714', 'pub.1005164845', 'pub.1026264741', 'pub.1063601448', 'pub.1013720200', 'pub.1012484919', 'pub.1112309896', 'pub.1020231504', 'pub.1031080592', 'pub.1033602454', 'pub.1027403393', 'pub.1111011157', 'pub.1112309901', 'pub.1010428391', 'pub.1030936557', 'pub.1109895932', 'pub.1047396745', 'pub.1002327029', 'pub.1033647418', 'pub.1038574032', 'pub.1039217893', 'pub.1101126749', 'pub.1121884579', 'pub.1053086472', 'pub.1010473453', 'pub.1111895246', 'pub.1023102736', 'pub.1050544184', 'pub.1026738352', 'pub.1035826376', 'pub.1053696632', 'pub.1006447159']"

We hypothesized that an ability to contemplate alternatives to perceptions of the current environment, i.e., flexibility in perspective shifting, may be essential to both dispositions. Dispositional shame may additionally relate to negative relational knowledge that involves a self-representation of being rejected. One hundred and six community participants rated the two dispositions, and had their flexibility in perspective shifting and internalized self-association with rejection assessed. Regression analysis indicated that a lower cost of perspective shifting was observed with dispositional guilt and shame. Yet, unlike a direct association with perspective shifting for dispositional guilt, it was an interaction between perspective shifting and negative relational knowledge that accounted for dispositional shame. The association of dispositional shame with perspective shifting was contingent upon the tendency to pair the self with rejection.",,Consciousness and Cognition,92,,1,"['Emotions', 'Guilt', 'Humans', 'Personality', 'Shame']","['pub.1063741056', 'pub.1061935910', 'pub.1005773151', 'pub.1085986551', 'pub.1056368367', 'pub.1085059930', 'pub.1015976871', 'pub.1020957241', 'pub.1020337558', 'pub.1045547448', 'pub.1105761252', 'pub.1034135275', 'pub.1028241812', 'pub.1113703464', 'pub.1008853223', 'pub.1056396605', 'pub.1138362214', 'pub.1021070103', 'pub.1043192367', 'pub.1047486312', 'pub.1004510104', 'pub.1011002240', 'pub.1029811318', 'pub.1002752064', 'pub.1020370242', 'pub.1030376819', 'pub.1030882087', 'pub.1046087698', 'pub.1047437569', 'pub.1043790896', 'pub.1135462034', 'pub.1003641546', 'pub.1073308954', 'pub.1030350246', 'pub.1019543365', 'pub.1007653299', 'pub.1008521336', 'pub.1004612955', 'pub.1022163933', 'pub.1021702952', 'pub.1040483485', 'pub.1050244113', 'pub.1046754447', 'pub.1036371186', 'pub.1013173720', 'pub.1043042476', 'pub.1103842097', 'pub.1027935179', 'pub.1031900491', 'pub.1035352333', 'pub.1004709821', 'pub.1010926018', 'pub.1041461240', 'pub.1025106030', 'pub.1036527898', 'pub.1052793432', 'pub.1050424819', 'pub.1121664722', 'pub.1103659025', 'pub.1013037932', 'pub.1022957661', 'pub.1004473261', 'pub.1001536175', 'pub.1044824241', 'pub.1050632111', 'pub.1010606852', 'pub.1009843166', 'pub.1011729725', 'pub.1004794430', 'pub.1050951134', 'pub.1033670032']"

In Study 2, in addition to exposure time, we also manipulated the spatial frequency of faces, by preserving either their fine (high spatial frequency) or coarse (low spatial frequency) information, to examine its effect on faces' perceived animacy and uncanniness. We found that perceived animacy decreased as a function of exposure time only in android but not in human or mechanical-looking robot faces (Study 1). In addition, the manipulation of spatial frequency eliminated the decrease in android faces' perceived animacy and reduced their perceived uncanniness (Study 2).

First, a culturally modified resilience education intervention was developed by employing the SPARK resilience program and implemented with 407 Japanese high school students in Tokyo (age = 15-16, M = 192, F = 215). To test intervention efficacy, students' level of resilience, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and depression were measured pre-, post-, and three months after intervention. Additionally, sensory processing sensitivity, using the Japanese version of the Highly Sensitive Child Scale for Adolescence, was measured as an index of individual sensitivity. Analysis of variance was used to examine the baseline differences and interaction effects of students' gender and level of sensory processing sensitivity. Latent growth curve models were used to assess the overall effects of the intervention and change over time. Results indicated that the intervention was effective in enhancing students' overall self-efficacy; and that highly sensitive students, who scored significantly lower in well-being than their counterparts at baseline, responded more positively to the intervention, and had a greater reduction in depression and promotion of self-esteem. These findings provided unique evidence in line with the differential susceptibility perspective and useful implications to develop personalized treatment interventions for adolescents in different cultural contexts.","The authors received no specific funding for this work.

Two preregistered longitudinal experiments (Study 1: Canadian adults; Study 2: American and Canadian adults; total <i>N</i> = 555) tested whether encouraging distanced (i.e., third-person) self-reflection would help promote wisdom. Both experiments measured wise reasoning (i.e., intellectual humility, open-mindedness about how situations could unfold, consideration of and attempts to integrate diverse viewpoints) about challenging interpersonal events. In a month-long experiment (Study 1), participants used either a third- or first-person perspective in diary reflections on each day's most significant experience. Compared with preintervention assessments, assessments made after the intervention revealed that participants reflecting in the third person showed a significant increase in wise reasoning about interpersonal challenges. These effects were statistically accounted for by shifts in diary-based reflections toward a broader self-focus. A week-long experiment (Study 2) replicated the third-person self-reflection effect on wise reasoning (vs. first-person and no-pronoun control conditions). These findings suggest an efficient and evidence-based method for fostering wise reasoning.","Takuya Shibayuma, Nadine Bolineu, Mane Kara-Yakoubian, Oliver Twardus, and Tianrong Sun provided valuable assistance with qualitative coding, and Sonia Vintan and Konstantyn Sharpinsky provided assistance with data-integrity cross-validation.",Psychological Science,32,3,5,"['Adult', 'Canada', 'Humans', 'Problem Solving', 'Research Design', 'United States']","['pub.1029955214', 'pub.1114059327', 'pub.1015927361', 'pub.1024025823', 'pub.1033115967', 'pub.1084247816', 'pub.1024585197', 'pub.1087901367', 'pub.1012750369', 'pub.1006645800', 'pub.1120450395', 'pub.1015067644', 'pub.1110093172', 'pub.1128403198', 'pub.1111681978', 'pub.1111491796', 'pub.1068672886', 'pub.1010231503', 'pub.1084130188', 'pub.1019405177', 'pub.1014263290', 'pub.1053615197', 'pub.1004695856', 'pub.1046453676', 'pub.1128698664', 'pub.1110458929', 'pub.1009133060', 'pub.1025880625', 'pub.1128565824', 'pub.1015800119', 'pub.1021557563', 'pub.1024453579', 'pub.1123430814', 'pub.1010393407', 'pub.1042809125', 'pub.1037572937', 'pub.1011111261', 'pub.1033540933', 'pub.1053384762', 'pub.1091931429', 'pub.1017932839', 'pub.1044695672', 'pub.1044850326', 'pub.1087034172', 'pub.1048607156', 'pub.1000462696', 'pub.1011327398', 'pub.1113397719', 'pub.1041137123', 'pub.1052232353', 'pub.1035451966', 'pub.1030360962']"

122,Of tinfoil hats and thinking caps: Reasoning is more strongly related to implausible than plausible conspiracy beliefs,"Michael Hattersley, Gordon D A Brown, John Michael, Elliot A Ludvig",Elsevier,2021-11-20,10.1016/j.cognition.2021.104956,pub.1142711684,"People who strongly endorse conspiracy theories typically exhibit biases in domain-general reasoning. We describe an overfitting hypothesis, according to which (a) such theories overfit conspiracy-related data at the expense of wider generalisability, and (b) reasoning biases reflect, at least in part, the need to reduce the resulting dissonance between the conspiracy theory and wider data. This hypothesis implies that reasoning biases should be more closely associated with belief in implausible conspiracy theories (e.g., the moon landing was faked) than with more plausible ones (e.g., the Russian Federation orchestrated the attack on Sergei Skripal). In two pre-registered studies, we found that endorsement of implausible conspiracy theories, but not plausible ones, was associated with reduced information sampling in an information-foraging task and with less reflective reasoning. Thus, the relationship between belief in conspiracy theories and reasoning is not homogeneous, and reasoning is not linked specifically to the ""conspiracy"" aspect of conspiracy theories. Instead, it may reflect an adaptive response to the tension between implausible theories and other beliefs and data.",We are grateful to Tom Kelly for feedback on an earlier draft of this manuscript.

Yet the wealth of data generated from the many sensors on these wearables and smartwatches has not yet transformed routine clinical care. One central reason for this gap between data and clinical insights is the lack of transparency and standards around data generated from mobile device that hinders interoperability and reproducibility. The clinical informatics community has offered solutions via the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard which facilities electronic health record interoperability but is less developed towards precision temporal contextually-tagged sensor measurements generated from today's ubiquitous mobile devices. In this paper we explore the opportunities and challenges of various theoretical approaches towards FHIR compatible digital phenotyping, and offer a concrete example implementing one such framework as an Application Programming Interface (API) for the open-source mindLAMP platform.

A range of disciplines contribute to our understanding of the influence of drugs upon the human world. For example pharmacology and neuroscience analyse biological responses to drugs, sociology examines social influences upon people's decisions to use drugs, and anthropology provides rich accounts of use across a variety of cultural contexts. This article reviews work from multiple disciplines to illustrate that drugs influence aspects of culture from social life to religion, politics to trade, while acting as enablers of cultural change throughout human history. This broad view is valuable at a time when the influence not only of traditional drugs but a growing armoury of novel drugs is felt and debated.","I am grateful for valuable discussions with David Courtwright, Ed Hagen, Brian Hayden, Andrew Lawrence, Neil Levy, Angus Martin, Christian Mueller and Daniel Smail.",Brain Research Bulletin,126,Pt 1,15,"['Culture', 'Humans', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Social Behavior', 'Substance-Related Disorders']","['pub.1073469055', 'pub.1011841898', 'pub.1045123532', 'pub.1034223222', 'pub.1026436385', 'pub.1028227317', 'pub.1038235059', 'pub.1058857059', 'pub.1035186352', 'pub.1031478270', 'pub.1036378375', 'pub.1012874435', 'pub.1018192628', 'pub.1059971741', 'pub.1042301277', 'pub.1070707289', 'pub.1019174650', 'pub.1095866240', 'pub.1053410890', 'pub.1051555157', 'pub.1019414009', 'pub.1007156444', 'pub.1052154853', 'pub.1017863153', 'pub.1014301706', 'pub.1059971749', 'pub.1004375721', 'pub.1059971738', 'pub.1024980707', 'pub.1090699446', 'pub.1017038510', 'pub.1052741381', 'pub.1053017332', 'pub.1027677522', 'pub.1004178288', 'pub.1032595459', 'pub.1005443582', 'pub.1001086934', 'pub.1012529855', 'pub.1033554866', 'pub.1068333377', 'pub.1018967253', 'pub.1061924604', 'pub.1059971746', 'pub.1026185143', 'pub.1058715055', 'pub.1034302533', 'pub.1009588952', 'pub.1039916830', 'pub.1073427150', 'pub.1002074718', 'pub.1021413243', 'pub.1038684300', 'pub.1080558077', 'pub.1021934903', 'pub.1026911560', 'pub.1012550735', 'pub.1069732604', 'pub.1020688824', 'pub.1004718684', 'pub.1030354909', 'pub.1008223337', 'pub.1035770607', 'pub.1006168204', 'pub.1004597634', 'pub.1014219552', 'pub.1048482512', 'pub.1009517316', 'pub.1027969795', 'pub.1007072445', 'pub.1031396458', 'pub.1012107478', 'pub.1048217728', 'pub.1047134822', 'pub.1009828032', 'pub.1020514417', 'pub.1037761534', 'pub.1029092531', 'pub.1005175963', 'pub.1034723985', 'pub.1075849763', 'pub.1015865058', 'pub.1021452213', 'pub.1037544747', 'pub.1111387770', 'pub.1059971743', 'pub.1058670739', 'pub.1000203691', 'pub.1030802941', 'pub.1014301249', 'pub.1030454527', 'pub.1068333270', 'pub.1044872653', 'pub.1051992121', 'pub.1052397429', 'pub.1033737537', 'pub.1077909399', 'pub.1046630979', 'pub.1083426355', 'pub.1030572327', 'pub.1010904342', 'pub.1047648865', 'pub.1045418372', 'pub.1000030185', 'pub.1098669749', 'pub.1008340069', 'pub.1018236195', 'pub.1008977777', 'pub.1029628941', 'pub.1007023302', 'pub.1046797104', 'pub.1045469268', 'pub.1059971740', 'pub.1020953299', 'pub.1044206525', 'pub.1078566735', 'pub.1007514164', 'pub.1005931159', 'pub.1083630010', 'pub.1005312221', 'pub.1048251581', 'pub.1059971742', 'pub.1017700529', 'pub.1015533751', 'pub.1027446678', 'pub.1049879652', 'pub.1058524381', 'pub.1025159737', 'pub.1020230787', 'pub.1032071678', 'pub.1031858912', 'pub.1009376333', 'pub.1014717873', 'pub.1058408451', 'pub.1023523290', 'pub.1031927997', 'pub.1108248172', 'pub.1062558201', 'pub.1009226740', 'pub.1044783955', 'pub.1041533355', 'pub.1037725374', 'pub.1080007027', 'pub.1082740777', 'pub.1070181322', 'pub.1039153734', 'pub.1028165148', 'pub.1059971747', 'pub.1033554983', 'pub.1033670165', 'pub.1058662884', 'pub.1039104303', 'pub.1047960266', 'pub.1024628035', 'pub.1035160740', 'pub.1012255908', 'pub.1058523860', 'pub.1053078088', 'pub.1052939707', 'pub.1041094447', 'pub.1000561053', 'pub.1022719470', 'pub.1037239686', 'pub.1077609809', 'pub.1090075784', 'pub.1034394605', 'pub.1054770389', 'pub.1016670483', 'pub.1076625023', 'pub.1008353897', 'pub.1005103979', 'pub.1073375160', 'pub.1001973628', 'pub.1036367885', 'pub.1021604003', 'pub.1034372625', 'pub.1029482451', 'pub.1058845072', 'pub.1073401199', 'pub.1059971739', 'pub.1063351196', 'pub.1059971745', 'pub.1041554924', 'pub.1003384587', 'pub.1004496712', 'pub.1047129268', 'pub.1034046496', 'pub.1008460101', 'pub.1006528793']"

127,A comprehensive survey on computational methods of non-coding RNA and disease association prediction,"Xiujuan Lei, Thosini Bamunu Mudiyanselage, Yuchen Zhang, Chen Bian, Wei Lan, Ning Yu, Yi Pan",Oxford University Press (OUP),2020-12-21,10.1093/bib/bbaa350,pub.1132274561,"The studies on relationships between non-coding RNAs and diseases are widely carried out in recent years. A large number of experimental methods and technologies of producing biological data have also been developed. However, due to their high labor cost and production time, nowadays, calculation-based methods, especially machine learning and deep learning methods, have received a lot of attention and been used commonly to solve these problems. From a computational point of view, this survey mainly introduces three common non-coding RNAs, i.e. miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs, and the related computational methods for predicting their association with diseases. First, the mainstream databases of above three non-coding RNAs are introduced in detail. Then, we present several methods for RNA similarity and disease similarity calculations. Later, we investigate ncRNA-disease prediction methods in details and classify these methods into five types: network propagating, recommend system, matrix completion, machine learning and deep learning. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the applications of these five types of computational methods in predicting the associations between diseases and miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs, respectively.

129,The entertainment value of conspiracy theories,"Jan‐Willem Prooijen, Joline Ligthart, Sabine Rosema, Yang Xu",Wiley,2021-07-14,10.1111/bjop.12522,pub.1139688604,"Many citizens around the globe believe conspiracy theories. Why are conspiracy theories so appealing? Here, we propose that conspiracy theories elicit intense emotions independent of emotional valence. People therefore find conspiracy theories entertaining - that is, narratives that people perceive as interesting, exciting, and attention-grabbing - and such entertainment appraisals are positively associated with belief in them. Five studies supported these ideas. Participants were exposed to either a conspiratorial or a non-conspiratorial text about the Notre Dame fire (Study 1) or the death of Jeffrey Epstein (preregistered Study 2). The conspiratorial text elicited stronger entertainment appraisals and intense emotions (independent of emotional valence) than the non-conspiratorial text; moreover, entertainment appraisals mediated the effects of the manipulation on conspiracy beliefs. Study 3 indicated that participants endorsed stronger conspiracy beliefs when an election event was described in an entertaining rather than a boring manner. Subsequent findings revealed that both organisational (Study 4) and societal conspiracy beliefs (Study 5) are positively associated with sensation seeking - a trait characterised by a preference for exciting and intense experiences. We conclude that one reason why people believe conspiracy theories is because they find them entertaining.",,British Journal of Psychology,113,1,1,"['Humans', 'Pandemics', 'Politics']","['pub.1011729304', 'pub.1022481343', 'pub.1001980645', 'pub.1091287469', 'pub.1006397192', 'pub.1052962407', 'pub.1016367549', 'pub.1085560296', 'pub.1012900057', 'pub.1008194006', 'pub.1050538127', 'pub.1062457887', 'pub.1037048087', 'pub.1053108605', 'pub.1004598021', 'pub.1023428881', 'pub.1037655062', 'pub.1022413668', 'pub.1038436273', 'pub.1069641248', 'pub.1015550878', 'pub.1123830219', 'pub.1110510307', 'pub.1090627069', 'pub.1022222500', 'pub.1040439379', 'pub.1036395248', 'pub.1129045997', 'pub.1009275249', 'pub.1044533652', 'pub.1073453864', 'pub.1103425784', 'pub.1035585730', 'pub.1048039971', 'pub.1070451972', 'pub.1005552612', 'pub.1107111666', 'pub.1046032240', 'pub.1008899024', 'pub.1006060598', 'pub.1035500410', 'pub.1015789442', 'pub.1111512405', 'pub.1090559050', 'pub.1001151415', 'pub.1105949856', 'pub.1000400222', 'pub.1124944343', 'pub.1021730738', 'pub.1031594247', 'pub.1022637723', 'pub.1044170714', 'pub.1099599151', 'pub.1123196875', 'pub.1028533438', 'pub.1044265372', 'pub.1108123110', 'pub.1041931693', 'pub.1041674084', 'pub.1120988373', 'pub.1033128645']"

They can be highly resilient and pose significant challenges and threats to the function and viability of multiple nested and interconnected human (and at times natural) systems. Various meanings and practices of resilience have accordingly occupied a critical but vexed position within multisystemic approaches to preventing and countering violent extremism policy and practice. A strong focus on identifying and building the resilience of individuals and communities has come at the expense of understanding the ways in which the institutional and governmental co-occurring systems involved in countering terrorism may themselves be less or more resilient and what this means for future efforts to effectively prevent violent extremism.</p>",,,,,0,,

Neumann,Taylor & Francis,2013-05-16,10.1080/1057610x.2013.784568,pub.1002235676,"The purpose of this article is to inform the debate about strategies and options for countering online radicalization within the U.S. domestic context. Its aim is to provide a better understanding of how the Internet facilitates radicalization; an appreciation of the dilemmas and tradeoffs that are involved in countering online radicalization within the United States; and ideas and best practices for making the emerging approach and strategy richer and more effective. It argues that online radicalization can be dealt with in three ways. Approaches aimed at restricting freedom of speech and removing content from the Internet are not only the least desirable, they are also the least effective. Instead, government should play a more energetic role in reducing the demand for radicalization and violent extremist messages—for example, by encouraging civic challenges to extremist narratives and by promoting awareness and education of young people. In the short term, the most promising way for dealing with the presence of violent extremists and their propaganda on the Internet is to exploit their online communications to gain intelligence and gather evidence in the most comprehensive and systematic fashion possible.",,Studies in Conflict and Terrorism,36,6,70,,

METHOD: Nested within a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, 241 participants received an 8-week supported iCBT intervention for anxiety and/or depression and answered open-ended questions about their use and experience of CBT skills at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up. Recurrent, cross-sectional qualitative analysis following the descriptive and interpretive approach was used to create a taxonomy, through which all qualitative data was coded.
RESULTS: In total, 479 qualitative responses across 181 participants were analysed. Participants reported using a wide range of CBT skills and associated helpful and hindering experiences and impacts. The reasons for discontinued CBT skills usage were diverse, ranging from rare adverse effects to healthy adaptation.
CONCLUSION: The study shows how clients receiving iCBT in routine care learn CBT skills during treatment and utilize them in productive ways post-treatment.

Amongst possible prevention approaches, internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) have been shown to be effective and scalable. However, little is known about the effectiveness in green professions. The aim of the present study is to examine the (cost-)effectiveness of a tailored IMI program for reducing depressive symptoms and preventing the onset of clinical depression compared to enhanced treatment as usual (TAU+).
METHODS: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate a tailored and therapeutically guided preventive IMI program in comparison to TAU+ with follow-ups at post-treatment (9 weeks), 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-months. Entrepreneurs in green professions, collaborating spouses, family members and pensioners (N = 360) with sufficient insurance status and at least subthreshold depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 5) are eligible for inclusion. Primary outcome is depressive symptom severity (QIDS-SR16). Secondary outcomes include incidence of depression (QIDS-SR16), quality of life (AQoL-8D) and negative treatment effects (INEP). A health-economic evaluation will be conducted from a societal perspective. The IMI program is provided by psychologists of an external service company and consists of six guided IMIs (6-8 modules, duration: 6-8 weeks) targeting different symptoms (depressive mood, depressive mood with comorbid diabetes, perceived stress, insomnia, panic and agoraphobic symptoms or harmful alcohol use). Intervention choice depends on a screening of participants' symptoms and individual preferences. The intervention phase is followed by a 12-months consolidating phase with monthly contact to the e-coach.
DISCUSSION: This is the first pragmatic RCT investigating long-term effectiveness of a tailored guided IMI program for depression prevention in green professions. The present trial builds on a large-scale strategy for depression prevention in green professions. The intended implementation of the IMI program with a nationwide rollout has the potential to reduce overall depression burden and associated health care costs in case of given effectiveness.

Without effective medications or vaccines available, authorities turned toward mitigation measures such as use of face masks, school's closings, shelter-in-place, telework and social distancing. People found refuge on the internet and social media apps; however, there was a proliferation of instant messaging containing hoaxed, deliberate misleading information: fake news messaging (FNM). The aim of this study was to assess FNM through content analysis and to discriminate them in a proposed taxonomy structure. A sample of convenience of messages, memes, tweets or cartoons in several languages was selected from the most popular social media outlets, i.e. Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter etc. More than 300 FNM were identified. Descriptive statistics were used for highlighting potential relationships between variables. Content analysis determined that FNM could be divided into Health- and non-health-related types. There are several sub-types considering, but not limited to, religious beliefs, politics, economy, nutrition, behaviors, prevention of the infection, the origin of the disease and conspiracy theories. The parallel FNM pandemic affected the response from an already debilitated public health system through the confusion created in the community and the erosion in the credibility of genuine media. Public health practitioners had to face people's unpredictable behaviors, panic, tensions with the communities and, in some cases, a hostile climate toward frontline workers. Public health practitioners must adjust ongoing and future health promotion and education interventions including plans to neutralize fake news messages.",,Health Promotion International,36,2,12,"['COVID-19', 'Communicable Disease Control', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Communication', 'Humans', 'Pandemics', 'Politics', 'Religion', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Media']","['pub.1106041888', 'pub.1120437701', 'pub.1001173061', 'pub.1130900175', 'pub.1125986071', 'pub.1053463751', 'pub.1128420938', 'pub.1126754855', 'pub.1110273801', 'pub.1126092838', 'pub.1128525781', 'pub.1129535442', 'pub.1126504508', 'pub.1026335173', 'pub.1126894983', 'pub.1001582056', 'pub.1129258298', 'pub.1128768499', 'pub.1085108382', 'pub.1125623018', 'pub.1130153570', 'pub.1106342390', 'pub.1101382661', 'pub.1125610931', 'pub.1023195049', 'pub.1125924294', 'pub.1127418181', 'pub.1075044377', 'pub.1129809832', 'pub.1059639581', 'pub.1128200963']"

141,Social behavior in RASopathies and idiopathic autism,"Allison M. H. Foy, Rebekah L. Hudock, Ryan Shanley, Elizabeth I. Pierpont",Springer Nature,2022-01-12,10.1186/s11689-021-09414-w,pub.1144606976,"BACKGROUND: RASopathies are genetic syndromes that result from pathogenic variants in the RAS-MAPK cellular signaling pathway. These syndromes, which include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, and Costello syndrome, are associated with a complex array of medical and behavioral health complications. Despite a heightened risk for social challenges and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), few studies have compared different aspects of social behavior across these conditions. It is also unknown whether the underlying neuropsychological characteristics that contribute to social competence and socially empathetic (""prosocial"") behaviors differ in children with RASopathies as compared to children with nonsyndromic (i.e., idiopathic) ASD.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional, survey-based investigation, caregivers of preschool and school-aged children with RASopathies (n = 202) or with idiopathic ASD (n = 109) provided demographic, medical, and developmental information about their child, including psychiatric comorbidities. For children who were able to communicate verbally, caregivers also completed standardized rating scales to assess social competence and empathetic behavior as well as symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention and emotional problems.
RESULTS: As compared to children with idiopathic ASD, children with RASopathies were rated as demonstrating more resilience in the domain of empathy relative to their overall social competence. Similarities and differences emerged in the psychological factors that predicted social behavior in these two groups. Stronger communication skills and fewer hyperactive-impulsive behaviors were associated with increased empathy and social competence for both groups. Greater emotional challenges were associated with lower social competence for children with RASopathies and stronger empathy for children with idiopathic ASD. Among children with RASopathy and a co-occurring ASD diagnosis, socially empathetic behaviors were observed more often as compared to children with idiopathic ASD.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the development of social behavior among children with RASopathies involves a distinct pattern of strengths and weaknesses as compared to a behaviorally defined disorder (idiopathic ASD). Identification of areas of resilience as well as behavioral and social challenges will support more targeted intervention.",The authors would like to express gratitude to families and advocacy groups who helped to support this work.,Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders,14,1,0,,"['pub.1041783907', 'pub.1013970652', 'pub.1007829231', 'pub.1044668963', 'pub.1098700973', 'pub.1067984581', 'pub.1047058586', 'pub.1041028015', 'pub.1006609700', 'pub.1051140064', 'pub.1036567322', 'pub.1106097824', 'pub.1054776683', 'pub.1085776480', 'pub.1040017460', 'pub.1100897208', 'pub.1039152312', 'pub.1047765311', 'pub.1047905444', 'pub.1107968130', 'pub.1050249412', 'pub.1022110192', 'pub.1029056257', 'pub.1029674675', 'pub.1031652932', 'pub.1028875938', 'pub.1048690917', 'pub.1054777116', 'pub.1039337749', 'pub.1072343402', 'pub.1091978548', 'pub.1020347934', 'pub.1121385441', 'pub.1110196459', 'pub.1045568514', 'pub.1038062576', 'pub.1006153614', 'pub.1134591338', 'pub.1008872528', 'pub.1040483860', 'pub.1018287704', 'pub.1033698405', 'pub.1049321469', 'pub.1043158105', 'pub.1024215852', 'pub.1004767212', 'pub.1020374244', 'pub.1014176267', 'pub.1001032526', 'pub.1053060259', 'pub.1001243441', 'pub.1050212183', 'pub.1064374848', 'pub.1053777512', 'pub.1024382535', 'pub.1035185662', 'pub.1049323229', 'pub.1006174614', 'pub.1038714402', 'pub.1045740484', 'pub.1106154621', 'pub.1041948135', 'pub.1083535162', 'pub.1034611709', 'pub.1046756294', 'pub.1049530388', 'pub.1025010781', 'pub.1078839834', 'pub.1014871665', 'pub.1125931359', 'pub.1035889756', 'pub.1103273889', 'pub.1002233567', 'pub.1037868392', 'pub.1007022390', 'pub.1104895030', 'pub.1078486039', 'pub.1007782026', 'pub.1038499171', 'pub.1039634666', 'pub.1074243592', 'pub.1025919748', 'pub.1112385215', 'pub.1041849302', 'pub.1007263999', 'pub.1051353760', 'pub.1084527326', 'pub.1004653875', 'pub.1010011536', 'pub.1054777239', 'pub.1004190772', 'pub.1064347484', 'pub.1097032812', 'pub.1009867283', 'pub.1035878866', 'pub.1007188964', 'pub.1009133514', 'pub.1013546013', 'pub.1067538271', 'pub.1046396702', 'pub.1017947937', 'pub.1018729092']"

However, research on the mechanism underlying the relationship between honesty-humility and prosocial behavior is rather scarce. This study aims to explore the internal mechanism underlying this relationship to draw a complete picture of the honesty-humility trait. A sample of 458 Chinese young adults was obtained to complete self-report measures of honesty-humility, perspective taking, guilt-proneness, and prosocial behavior. The mediation model revealed that: (1) honesty-humility positively related to prosocial behavior; (2) perspective taking and guilt-proneness mediated the relationship between honesty-humility and prosocial behavior, separately; and (3) the effect of honesty-humility on prosocial behavior was mediated via perspective taking and then guilt-proneness. In conclusion, we provide an initial support for the mediating roles of perspective taking and guilt-proneness in the relationship between honesty-humility and prosocial behavior.

143,How Well Does Evolution Explain Endogenous Retroviruses?—A Lakatosian Assessment,Ruben N Jorritsma,MDPI,2021-12-22,10.3390/v14010014,pub.1144156194,"One of the most sophisticated philosophies of science is the methodology of scientific research programmes (MSRP), developed by Imre Lakatos. According to MSRP, scientists are working within so-called research programmes, consisting of a hard core of fixed convictions and a flexible protective belt of auxiliary hypotheses. Anomalies are accommodated by changes to the protective belt that do not affect the hard core. Under MSRP, research programmes are appraised as 'progressive' if they successfully predict novel facts but are judged as 'degenerative' if they merely offer ad hoc solutions to anomalies. This paper applies these criteria to the evolutionary research programme as it has performed during half a century of ERV research. It describes the early history of the field and the emergence of the endogenization-amplification theory on the origins of retroviral-like sequences. It then discusses various predictions and postdictions that were generated by the programme, regarding orthologous ERVs in different species, the presence of target site duplications and the divergence of long terminal repeats, and appraises how the programme has dealt with data that did not conform to initial expectations. It is concluded that the evolutionary research programme has been progressive with regard to the issues here examined.",I thank Henk Jochemsen and Bart Gremmen for their support during the project and for critically reading the manuscript.

Can psychology help? The focus of this review is on the psychological and related social factors that instigate and sustain violent extremism and polarizing group conflict. I first describe the changing global landscape of transnational terrorism, encompassing mainly violent Islamist revivalism and resurgent racial and ethnic supremacism. Next, I explore the psychosocial nature of the devoted actor and rational actor frameworks, focusing on how sacred values, identity fusion, and social network dynamics motivate and maintain extreme violence. The psychology of the will to fight and die is illustrated in behavioral and brain studies with frontline combatants in Iraq, militant supporters in Morocco, and radicalizing populations in Spain. This is followed by a consideration of how to deal with value-driven conflicts and a discussion of how the Internet and social media encourage the propagation of polarized conflict.",,Annual Review of Psychology,72,1,10,"['Aggression', 'Dissent and Disputes', 'Humans', 'Motivation', 'Social Identification', 'Terrorism', 'Violence']","['pub.1099746738', 'pub.1120437701', 'pub.1035316958', 'pub.1098662781', 'pub.1025909974', 'pub.1115222911', 'pub.1016376127', 'pub.1021631162', 'pub.1049668548', 'pub.1023642739', 'pub.1023902316', 'pub.1099497944', 'pub.1018661347', 'pub.1033848722', 'pub.1000601908', 'pub.1009575648', 'pub.1003624401', 'pub.1012595868', 'pub.1058866809', 'pub.1049959888', 'pub.1107953344', 'pub.1120307262', 'pub.1074220612', 'pub.1034266650', 'pub.1046364731', 'pub.1035840284', 'pub.1041589028', 'pub.1125683678', 'pub.1063350583', 'pub.1120682762', 'pub.1062456147', 'pub.1047870634', 'pub.1017895495', 'pub.1019339259', 'pub.1000491370', 'pub.1003108700', 'pub.1104158164', 'pub.1099466408', 'pub.1027545226', 'pub.1000122265', 'pub.1036135010', 'pub.1102989078', 'pub.1041626261', 'pub.1029315959', 'pub.1111800020', 'pub.1011114362', 'pub.1068848599', 'pub.1100866546', 'pub.1007459003', 'pub.1117071275', 'pub.1037395932', 'pub.1002910064', 'pub.1108128574', 'pub.1022124113', 'pub.1091431909', 'pub.1058867490', 'pub.1028822897', 'pub.1033449495', 'pub.1037107067', 'pub.1017494755', 'pub.1042877438', 'pub.1126636315', 'pub.1074211439', 'pub.1043656175', 'pub.1112527480', 'pub.1062456148', 'pub.1025708548', 'pub.1014448707', 'pub.1120447731', 'pub.1008220074', 'pub.1126910180', 'pub.1017044328', 'pub.1016518923', 'pub.1038980332', 'pub.1111657761', 'pub.1012071983', 'pub.1124956956', 'pub.1085871263', 'pub.1089122269', 'pub.1089080300', 'pub.1046318797', 'pub.1050888940', 'pub.1091807455', 'pub.1020635600', 'pub.1099535065', 'pub.1110818715', 'pub.1140242757', 'pub.1000407942', 'pub.1099568958', 'pub.1023817527']"
145,"Smart energy systems beyond the age of COVID-19: Towards a new order of monitoring, disciplining and sanctioning energy behavior?",Jörg Radtke,Elsevier,2021-10-22,10.1016/j.erss.2021.102355,pub.1142045244,"The Corona pandemic has led to the increased use of online tools throughout society, whether in business, education, or daily life. This shift to an online society has led social scientists to question the extent to which increased forms of control, surveillance and enforced conformity to ways of thinking, attitudes and behaviors can be promoted through online activities. This question arises overtly amidst a pandemic, but it also lurks behind the widespread diffusion of smart energy systems throughout the world and the increased use of smart meters in those systems. The extent to which forms of monitoring, disciplining and sanctioning of energy behavior and practices could come to reality is thus an important question to consider. This article does so using the ideas of Michel Foucault, together with research on smart energy systems and current trends in energy policy. The article closes with a discussion of energy democracy and democratic legitimacy in the context of possible effects of smart technologies on community energy systems.",,Energy Research & Social Science,84,,0,,"['pub.1129150342', 'pub.1131947404', 'pub.1128849486', 'pub.1123119568', 'pub.1005383706', 'pub.1128698810', 'pub.1021917937', 'pub.1106004912', 'pub.1105260837', 'pub.1122185567', 'pub.1005583064', 'pub.1016197270', 'pub.1043769212', 'pub.1125335612', 'pub.1134361426', 'pub.1093027044', 'pub.1123727645', 'pub.1120311776', 'pub.1129075010', 'pub.1105810979', 'pub.1141918111', 'pub.1105643991', 'pub.1063904512', 'pub.1117376244', 'pub.1024651680', 'pub.1000130022', 'pub.1128950153', 'pub.1120403047', 'pub.1110231910', 'pub.1105846423', 'pub.1129426013', 'pub.1129900500', 'pub.1139665450', 'pub.1136501305', 'pub.1106197579', 'pub.1133401002', 'pub.1103604211', 'pub.1133341085', 'pub.1128226524', 'pub.1131134977', 'pub.1136555107', 'pub.1139276771', 'pub.1138725347', 'pub.1038751567', 'pub.1072668266', 'pub.1109907393', 'pub.1127700339', 'pub.1111319768', 'pub.1099794817', 'pub.1117609835', 'pub.1058159483', 'pub.1138041781', 'pub.1105228692', 'pub.1106024148', 'pub.1086297624', 'pub.1139806757', 'pub.1138218452', 'pub.1063811877', 'pub.1083919422', 'pub.1033139804', 'pub.1009782824', 'pub.1006105813', 'pub.1105970445', 'pub.1021779913', 'pub.1037737378', 'pub.1128629337', 'pub.1114114617', 'pub.1113145004', 'pub.1134992711', 'pub.1113194260', 'pub.1120130311', 'pub.1139872112', 'pub.1137466426', 'pub.1092728626', 'pub.1139976529', 'pub.1135228104', 'pub.1084170643', 'pub.1122100910', 'pub.1091629193', 'pub.1117997628', 'pub.1039389124', 'pub.1015660814', 'pub.1127649162', 'pub.1115882362', 'pub.1117342509', 'pub.1052136008', 'pub.1125631584', 'pub.1105872135', 'pub.1106058668', 'pub.1085291238', 'pub.1124052752', 'pub.1124117564', 'pub.1024149961', 'pub.1051207312', 'pub.1113194274', 'pub.1140052130', 'pub.1103412834', 'pub.1107259009', 'pub.1128835500', 'pub.1033316961', 'pub.1127793982', 'pub.1139171198', 'pub.1101379261', 'pub.1134319827', 'pub.1127246074', 'pub.1138396306', 'pub.1074187370', 'pub.1127866244', 'pub.1136723473', 'pub.1137464048', 'pub.1085747424', 'pub.1136989040', 'pub.1124845918', 'pub.1084475402', 'pub.1139468545', 'pub.1133204493', 'pub.1107373452', 'pub.1128468423', 'pub.1138951683', 'pub.1009387665', 'pub.1011050248', 'pub.1060024404', 'pub.1107744303', 'pub.1104224565', 'pub.1092537037', 'pub.1127385159', 'pub.1042933648', 'pub.1124455566', 'pub.1128098093', 'pub.1030701652', 'pub.1138359955', 'pub.1086104998', 'pub.1136537607', 'pub.1136613361', 'pub.1136647637', 'pub.1122014126', 'pub.1091896885', 'pub.1135267729', 'pub.1108038991', 'pub.1032768482', 'pub.1128056901', 'pub.1131192137', 'pub.1030807177', 'pub.1113330365', 'pub.1105808126', 'pub.1130933379', 'pub.1107824207', 'pub.1043382869', 'pub.1139809580', 'pub.1013500701', 'pub.1012128742', 'pub.1138062594', 'pub.1122185564', 'pub.1015148662', 'pub.1116645814', 'pub.1127593503', 'pub.1127815564', 'pub.1129075009', 'pub.1090364330', 'pub.1112761135', 'pub.1124547020', 'pub.1102388747', 'pub.1137539810', 'pub.1107853847', 'pub.1003769024', 'pub.1128246917', 'pub.1130114339', 'pub.1139594854', 'pub.1009829034', 'pub.1094805979', 'pub.1107040054', 'pub.1117370342', 'pub.1012686842', 'pub.1092759400', 'pub.1028756689', 'pub.1022024980', 'pub.1061546895', 'pub.1093657963', 'pub.1014910648', 'pub.1085455464', 'pub.1132573439', 'pub.1051395991', 'pub.1139282331', 'pub.1122679655', 'pub.1107605292', 'pub.1122304181', 'pub.1125619092', 'pub.1084063072', 'pub.1129725448', 'pub.1035241672', 'pub.1138976219', 'pub.1006229242', 'pub.1139118151', 'pub.1012293505', 'pub.1007571336', 'pub.1137465629', 'pub.1092535226', 'pub.1006273937', 'pub.1131533548', 'pub.1053428825', 'pub.1128560043', 'pub.1106985455', 'pub.1135749892', 'pub.1027258161', 'pub.1136414029', 'pub.1128117685', 'pub.1099922467', 'pub.1064026180', 'pub.1105831201', 'pub.1109707647', 'pub.1120901034', 'pub.1105736925', 'pub.1132497488', 'pub.1140974578', 'pub.1123667124', 'pub.1120506946', 'pub.1112655322', 'pub.1127557969', 'pub.1138872023', 'pub.1127603408', 'pub.1038478405', 'pub.1137294146', 'pub.1127765172', 'pub.1136814927']"

This paper reviews current guidelines and recent publications to identify ethical issues and suggested solutions in recruitment, data management, and informed consent.Recent FindingsAcross eHealth HIV research, recruitment, data collection, and storage efforts to protect informational risk highlight the tension between the investigators’ ability to protect participant confidentiality and the evolving informational risk posed by the online platforms on which they are operating. Adequately addressing these challenges requires updating technical competencies and educating participants on their own responsibilities to guard against privacy violations. Additional protections are required when interventions involve peer or community support, especially with minors.SummaryThe rapid progression of technology presents challenges in solidifying best practices for future interventions.

147,Achieving and Maintaining Safety in Healthcare Requires Unwavering Institutional and Individual Commitments,"Daniele Rigamonti, Karen H Rigamonti",Cureus,2021-02-07,10.7759/cureus.13192,pub.1135227941,"In 2000, ""To Err Is Human"" brought to light the fact that the estimated number of people dying from medical errors occurring in hospitals exceeded those that die from motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), breast cancer, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) - three causes receiving far more public attention. The report prompted the gradual adoption of safety processes developed in the nuclear and aviation industries. However, sophisticated engineering solutions to operations are not enough. High and low mortality hospitals have similar processes and procedures, but low-mortality hospitals are more proficient at recognizing and managing serious complications as they unfold. This ability to rescue a deteriorating situation (resilience) reflects a healthier safety culture. Organizations move within the safety space in the direction of either more or less resilience depending on the fluctuation of their safety culture. Improving resilience requires transforming learned safety practices into a ""habit"" in conjunction with accepting accountability. Personal accountability means commitment to safe practices along with effective and transparent reporting of near misses/close calls and adverse events (AEs). Institutional accountability means putting safety first by ensuring the availability of appropriate resources, role leadership modeling, and effective management of sentinel events (SEs) to reduce harm occurrence and re-occurrence. This requires a more robust root cause analysis (RCA) process to guarantee that action plans produce strong and effective corrective measures. Synergistic coaching interventions include instilling the awareness that failure can and will happen, mapping team talents, and assessing gaps. These interventions will optimize group expertise, reaffirming the concept of institutional and personal accountability. The unending performance of drills will sustain the group resilience under both expected and unexpected conditions. Given the strong correlation between practice environment and outcomes, sustained improvement of the safety climate will produce more robust safety behaviors and ultimately better outcomes.","We would like to thank Prof. Kathleen Sutcliffe, Prof. Albert Wu, Prof. Chris Myers and Prof. Anna Mayo for their guidance.

148,Hallucinations in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Insights From Predictive Coding,"Stanley Lyndon, Philip R. Corlett",American Psychological Association (APA),2020-08,10.1037/abn0000531,pub.1127794478,"Although hallucinations are not one of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5)</i> criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), they are increasingly documented in PTSD. They are noted in the absence of clear delusions, formal thought disorganization, disorganized speech, or behavior, ruling out a comorbid psychotic disorder like schizophrenia as a better explanation for these hallucinations. Hallucinations in both PTSD and schizophrenia share phenomenological features. We propose that hallucinations in PTSD, like those in schizophrenia, might be explained in terms of aberrant predictive coding, specifically the misapplication of strong prior beliefs that vitiate perceptual inference. This approach highlights the broader relationship between trauma and psychosis. Under predictive coding, the nervous system organizes past sensory data into an internal model of the world. Under stress, the brain prioritizes speed over accurate encoding. However, memories for traumatic experiences are typically strongly consolidated, to avoid similar experiences in future. In PTSD, this could lead to a world model comprised of inaccurate but overly precise prior beliefs, that can be triggered by stimuli tangentially related to the index trauma, resulting in hallucinations. Crucially, this evidence accumulation depends upon the relative precision of prior beliefs and sensory evidence (supplied in the form of prediction errors). Our basic argument is that stressful situations induce belief updating, in terms of precise prior beliefs, that are difficult to undo. These unduly precise, trauma-related beliefs then constitute perceptual hypotheses, memories, or narratives that bias subsequent experience. This prior bias may be so severe that sensory evidence is effectively ignored; that is, treated as very imprecise, in relation to prior beliefs. Such an account may lead to cognitive therapies for hallucinations aimed at strong prior beliefs, and the exciting prospect of combining such therapies with drugs that modulate neuroplasticity and enhance the adaptive consolidation of more appropriate priors.

153,"Basic psychological needs, more than mindfulness and resilience, relate to medical student stress: A case for shifting the focus of wellness curricula","Adam Neufeld, Annik Mossière, Greg Malin",Taylor & Francis,2020-10-05,10.1080/0142159x.2020.1813876,pub.1131426545,"PURPOSE: Medical student distress is an increasing concern in medical education. Addressing this issue requires a comprehensive understanding of what factors influence learners' stress in medical school. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study explores the relative association between medical students' mindfulness, resilience, basic psychological needs, and perceived stress. <b>Materials and methods:</b> Of all year 1-4 medical students at our institution, 197 (49%) completed an online survey, measuring satisfaction and frustration of their basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness), mindfulness, resilience, and perceived stress. Variables were assessed in relation to perceived stress, controlling for students' gender and year.
RESULTS: Higher mindfulness, resilience, and need satisfaction were associated with lower perceived stress. Conversely, need frustration was associated with higher perceived stress. When students' need frustration was included in the model, the association between mindfulness, resilience, and perceived stress weakened. Third years reported more autonomy frustration than all other years. Compared to males, females in second and fourth year reported higher stress, lower mindfulness and resilience, and less competence fulfilment.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study suggest that, while mindfulness and resilience are important qualities for medical student well-being, their stress-protective benefits may diminish when students' basic psychological needs are frustrated in medical school. Addressing potentially need-thwarting aspects of the learning environment is therefore recommended, to help reduce student stress and promote their well-being. Preliminary suggestions on how this might be achieved are discussed, from an SDT perspective.",The authors report no conflicts of interest.

Svendsen",Wiley,2021-04-18,10.1111/maq.12647,pub.1137289467,"This article explores how incurable cancer patients in the affluent Danish welfare state are recruited to clinical trials. We show that patients' impending death constitutes their potential for being configured as research subjects. To produce valuable data, patients who enroll in trials and health care professionals must engage in daily ""time practices"" that prolong the threshold between life and death. When death becomes inevitable, the limit of configuring dying cancer patients as research subjects is reached. Navigating this temporal logic, health care professionals balance the boundary between patients' instrumental worth as research subjects and their intrinsic worth as dying cancer patients. Whereas previous studies have critically uncovered how clinical trials operate at socioeconomic margins, we point to the ways in which clinical trials operate through temporal margins. We argue that clinical trials are dependent on configuring marginal societal spaces and marginal bodies from which to produce knowledge.","Our sincere thanks to all patients and relatives at Unit One, who let us follow their participation in the clinical trials and engaged in conversations about living with advanced cancer.

165,Effectiveness of an Empathic Chatbot in Combating Adverse Effects of Social Exclusion on Mood,"Mauro de Gennaro, Eva G. Krumhuber, Gale Lucas",Frontiers,2020-01-23,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03061,pub.1124234709,"From past research it is well known that social exclusion has detrimental consequences for mental health. To deal with these adverse effects, socially excluded individuals frequently turn to other humans for emotional support. While chatbots can elicit social and emotional responses on the part of the human interlocutor, their effectiveness in the context of social exclusion has not been investigated. In the present study, we examined whether an empathic chatbot can serve as a buffer against the adverse effects of social ostracism. After experiencing exclusion on social media, participants were randomly assigned to either talk with an empathetic chatbot about it (e.g., ""I'm sorry that this happened to you"") or a control condition where their responses were merely acknowledged (e.g., ""Thank you for your feedback""). Replicating previous research, results revealed that experiences of social exclusion dampened the mood of participants. Interacting with an empathetic chatbot, however, appeared to have a mitigating impact. In particular, participants in the chatbot intervention condition reported higher mood than those in the control condition. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications, as well as directions for future research are discussed.",,Frontiers in Psychology,10,,25,,"['pub.1009031989', 'pub.1107712698', 'pub.1046181873', 'pub.1024585197', 'pub.1063740497', 'pub.1012542275', 'pub.1008538787', 'pub.1095181918', 'pub.1037921816', 'pub.1104317141', 'pub.1020092910', 'pub.1023416475', 'pub.1050013561', 'pub.1016185448', 'pub.1008185415', 'pub.1021606000', 'pub.1123110082', 'pub.1015441691', 'pub.1016573357', 'pub.1009497615', 'pub.1017409372', 'pub.1004157102', 'pub.1064052056', 'pub.1038897317', 'pub.1027667419', 'pub.1078523122', 'pub.1042223680', 'pub.1012235050', 'pub.1120682612', 'pub.1103568120', 'pub.1062510354', 'pub.1004965498', 'pub.1035808890', 'pub.1040464938', 'pub.1028449379', 'pub.1037366954', 'pub.1025028272', 'pub.1029932126', 'pub.1021082589', 'pub.1023246782', 'pub.1101482520', 'pub.1024577248', 'pub.1061949407', 'pub.1061784798', 'pub.1085711776', 'pub.1036259478', 'pub.1071127462', 'pub.1062448522', 'pub.1052119241', 'pub.1061446956', 'pub.1051758467', 'pub.1109864821', 'pub.1061486966', 'pub.1085715771', 'pub.1004298540', 'pub.1008696972', 'pub.1025973411', 'pub.1025725128', 'pub.1041975402', 'pub.1110109521', 'pub.1010489566', 'pub.1095928190', 'pub.1038667132', 'pub.1013856034', 'pub.1032579265', 'pub.1015248910', 'pub.1046976367', 'pub.1103623779', 'pub.1085376802', 'pub.1014993087', 'pub.1009133060', 'pub.1067629856', 'pub.1062448474', 'pub.1101214085', 'pub.1028064502', 'pub.1002449662', 'pub.1031094902', 'pub.1041112934', 'pub.1004050219', 'pub.1012356951', 'pub.1030345400', 'pub.1030402910', 'pub.1007958350', 'pub.1007368563', 'pub.1044063942', 'pub.1031832936', 'pub.1106346567', 'pub.1005967437', 'pub.1085903717', 'pub.1040374565', 'pub.1108232137', 'pub.1092188648', 'pub.1103873304', 'pub.1096035781', 'pub.1047539908', 'pub.1021300969', 'pub.1050709273', 'pub.1023874514', 'pub.1091351652', 'pub.1091494393', 'pub.1029931564', 'pub.1067629852', 'pub.1011048955', 'pub.1035013787', 'pub.1099671651', 'pub.1042719380', 'pub.1087306106', 'pub.1045164069', 'pub.1028670607', 'pub.1048897830', 'pub.1053499662', 'pub.1013720494', 'pub.1020553688', 'pub.1016586401']"

Despite its ubiquity, social prediction poses a poorly understood generalization problem: we cannot assume that others will repeat past behaviour in new settings or that their future actions are entirely unrelated to the past. We demonstrate that humans solve this challenge using a structure learning mechanism that uncovers other people’s latent, unobservable motives, such as greed and risk aversion. In four studies, participants (N = 501) predicted other players’ decisions across four economic games, each with different social tensions (for example, Prisoner’s Dilemma and Stag Hunt). Participants achieved accurate social prediction by learning the stable motivational structure underlying a player’s changing actions across games. This motive-based abstraction enabled participants to attend to information diagnostic of the player’s next move and disregard irrelevant contextual cues. Participants who successfully learned another’s motives were more strategic in a subsequent competitive interaction with that player in entirely new contexts, reflecting that social structure learning supports adaptive social behaviour.","We thank A.

Probing what distinguished them, separate participants rated the affect, attractiveness, competence, dominance, facial maturity, likability, and trustworthiness of the leaders' faces in Study 2. Relating these perceptions to the categorizations made by participants in Study 1 showed that democratically elected leaders looked significantly more attractive and warmer (an average of likability and trustworthiness) than dictators did.

In a pair of studies, we demonstrated that interracial contact and motivation to attend to faces jointly influence White perceivers' ability to infer mental states based on facial expressions displaying secondary emotions from both White targets alone (study 1) and White and Black targets (study 2; pre-registered). Consistent with previous work on the effect of motivation and interracial contact on other-race face memory, we found that motivation and interracial contact interacted to shape perceivers' accuracy at inferring mental states from secondary emotions. When motivated to attend to the task, high-contact White perceivers were more accurate at inferring both Black and White targets' mental states; unexpectedly, the opposite was true for low-contact perceivers. Importantly, the target race did not interact with interracial contact, suggesting that contact is associated with <i>general</i> changes in mentalizing irrespective of target race. These findings expand the theoretical understanding and implications of contact for fundamental social cognition.","We would like to thank Tanisha Jain for their assistance in the early stages of participant recruitment, stimulus piloting, and data collection.",Royal Society Open Science,8,7,1,,"['pub.1034100301', 'pub.1009532288', 'pub.1020804054', 'pub.1043891799', 'pub.1117579159', 'pub.1077063346', 'pub.1085111330', 'pub.1047872656', 'pub.1013994882', 'pub.1063974959', 'pub.1028626931', 'pub.1007183817', 'pub.1046213836', 'pub.1024192700', 'pub.1121116980', 'pub.1037773419', 'pub.1104141992', 'pub.1008757730', 'pub.1051573287', 'pub.1041556047', 'pub.1018023506', 'pub.1018166341', 'pub.1040748931', 'pub.1022062564', 'pub.1059458872', 'pub.1039392369', 'pub.1042564573', 'pub.1026374048', 'pub.1113810244', 'pub.1021097353', 'pub.1017668159', 'pub.1030623016', 'pub.1003432012', 'pub.1006257335', 'pub.1050753737', 'pub.1056368437', 'pub.1019543365', 'pub.1111099264', 'pub.1002584373', 'pub.1042044764', 'pub.1029273414', 'pub.1044139947', 'pub.1004487860', 'pub.1092186683', 'pub.1020837317', 'pub.1045334182', 'pub.1050212662', 'pub.1005404671', 'pub.1092348568', 'pub.1090707213', 'pub.1010105207', 'pub.1015244895', 'pub.1013746588', 'pub.1033636718', 'pub.1092025674', 'pub.1040528951', 'pub.1035066493', 'pub.1046902214', 'pub.1101559447', 'pub.1090589172', 'pub.1015487106', 'pub.1037688798', 'pub.1012182720', 'pub.1051067639', 'pub.1041921906', 'pub.1127627642', 'pub.1024698339', 'pub.1005263303', 'pub.1008634587', 'pub.1051293762', 'pub.1047124344', 'pub.1068673008', 'pub.1053499746', 'pub.1015844748', 'pub.1035972332']"

The current studies evaluated the impact of a sequential multiple message approach tailored to the usage norms of adolescents expressing negative attitudes toward a cannabis prevention appeal. A multiple-message strategy was implemented—initial unfavorable message evaluations were invalidated using attitudinal rebuttal feedback prior to presenting a third tailored communication. Participants were cannabis-abstinent middle and high school students (ages 11 to 16). Study 1 (N = 808) compared effects of gain- and loss-framed messages tailored to each student’s normative usage perceptions. In Study 2 (N = 391), students were randomly assigned to receive a tailored or non-tailored message after receiving feedback meant to destabilize anti-message attitudes. For at-risk adolescents in Study 1 who perceived cannabis use as normative, a tailored gain-framed message resulted in the lowest usage intentions (p < .05). In Study 2, a conditional multiple-moderated mediation model showed that for high-risk teens with normative beliefs and pro-cannabis attitudes, exposure to a tailored gain-framed communication was associated with decreased cannabis attitude certainty, and lower usage intentions 2 months later (p < .05).

The consensus ERE contains two inverted repeats of the 5'-AGGTCA-3' half-site (1/2 ERE) separated by three base pairs (bp). Many estrogen-responsive gene promoters contain one or more direct repeats (DR) of 1/2 ERE. Here, we examined the affinity of ERalpha and ERbeta binding and estradiol (E(2))-induced transactivation from select EREs and DRs. The affinity of ERalpha and ERbeta binding to imperfect EREs in vitro can be predicted from equations using the number of 1/2 EREs and the number of (AT)-(GC) bp substitutions within the 15-bp candidate ERE sequence as independent variables. Transactivation by ERalpha and ERbeta correlates with the affinity of ER-ERE binding with the exception of ERalpha from two low-affinity EREs. The equations developed here can be used to screen the promoters of estrogen-responsive genes for candidate ERE sequences.","We thank Edouard L.

Johnson, Erica Beall, Peter Meindl, Benjamin Smith, Jesse Graham",Wiley,2014-04-30,10.1002/wcs.1293,pub.1041231827,"Political psychology is a dynamic field of research that offers a unique blend of approaches and methods in the social and cognitive sciences. Political psychologists explore the interactions between macrolevel political structures and microlevel factors such as decision-making processes, motivations, and perceptions. In this article, we provide a broad overview of the field, beginning with a brief history of political psychology research and a summary of the primary methodological approaches in the field. We then give a more detailed account of research on ideology and social justice, two topics experiencing a resurgence of interest in current political psychology. Finally, we cover research on political persuasion and voting behavior.

177,"The amoral atheist? A cross-national examination of cultural, motivational, and cognitive antecedents of disbelief, and their implications for morality",Tomas Ståhl,Public Library of Science (PLoS),2021-02-24,10.1371/journal.pone.0246593,pub.1135706854,"There is a widespread cross-cultural stereotype suggesting that atheists are untrustworthy and lack a moral compass. Is there any truth to this notion? Building on theory about the cultural, (de)motivational, and cognitive antecedents of disbelief, the present research investigated whether there are reliable similarities as well as differences between believers and disbelievers in the moral values and principles they endorse. Four studies examined how religious disbelief (vs. belief) relates to endorsement of various moral values and principles in a predominately religious (vs. irreligious) country (the U.S. vs. Sweden). Two U.S. M-Turk studies (Studies 1A and 1B, N = 429) and two large cross-national studies (Studies 2-3, N = 4,193), consistently show that disbelievers (vs. believers) are less inclined to endorse moral values that serve group cohesion (the binding moral foundations). By contrast, only minor differences between believers and disbelievers were found in endorsement of other moral values (individualizing moral foundations, epistemic rationality). It is also demonstrated that presumed cultural and demotivational antecedents of disbelief (limited exposure to credibility-enhancing displays, low existential threat) are associated with disbelief. Furthermore, these factors are associated with weaker endorsement of the binding moral foundations in both countries (Study 2). Most of these findings were replicated in Study 3, and results also show that disbelievers (vs. believers) have a more consequentialist view of morality in both countries. A consequentialist view of morality was also associated with another presumed antecedent of disbelief-analytic cognitive style.","The research reported in this article was supported by a grant awarded to TS by the Understanding Unbelief Programme.

178,SymptomSpeak: Women’s Struggle for History and Health in Kosovo,Hanna Kienzler,Springer Nature,2021-08-31,10.1007/s11013-021-09746-1,pub.1140775507,"What are the linguistic dimensions of pain, and what kind of articulations arise from these painful experiences? How does the language of pain circulate, connect, and reach across histories, gendered realities, and social politics? In what ways might the language of pain act on and transform the world by shaping and changing socio-political agendas? I explored these questions among women in Kosovo and discovered a unique symptomatic language which I call SymptomSpeak. SymptomSpeak is a powerful language evoked, shared, and exchanged by women to articulate political, social, and economic grievances, to challenge societal norms, and to demand justice. The language itself consists of a detailed symptom vocabulary which is variously assembled into meaning complexes. Such assemblages shift depending on the social context in which they are conveyed and are referred to as nervoz (nervousness), mërzitna (worried, sad), mzysh (evil eye), and t’bone (spell). I describe in detail how women variously combine and exchange components of SymptomSpeak and, thereby, question dominant framings of reality. Thereby, my intention is to contribute to a new understanding of pain as language which straddles the fine line between socio-political commentary and illness; produces gendered political realities; and challenges the status quo through its communicative power.",,"Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry",,,0,,"['pub.1000223644', 'pub.1091051854', 'pub.1098832446', 'pub.1027630121', 'pub.1020431417', 'pub.1095866716', 'pub.1045972317', 'pub.1052584016', 'pub.1110926041', 'pub.1017745965', 'pub.1113986704', 'pub.1039986798', 'pub.1026502769', 'pub.1053248937']"
179,"Ensuring Effective Public Health Communication: Insights and Modeling Efforts From Theories of Behavioral Economics, Heuristics, and Behavioral Analysis for Decision Making Under Risk",Darren J. Edwards,Frontiers,2021-10-13,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.715159,pub.1141838140,"Public health (PH) messaging can have an enormous impact on shaping how individuals within society behave, and can ensure it is in a safe and responsible way, consistent with up-to-date evidence-based PH guidelines. If done effectively, messaging can save lives and improve the health of those within society. However, unfortunately, those within Government PH bodies typically have little training about how to effectively represent PH messages in a way that is consistent with psychological theories of cognitive bias, in order to avoid cognitively biasing the public through their messages. As a result of this, inadequate representation of PH messages can result, which can often lead to cognitive bias in those from the public who read or listen to the message information. This can lead to poor decision making of the pubic as a whole, which can then further lead to harm and even death of public members as a result of these poor decisions. One way to minimize the problem of bias in decision making is to explore psychology theories that model how bias can occur from PH messaging, and identify ways in which PH agencies can utilize such approaches to improve the effectiveness of their messages. Previous focus has been largely on behavioral economic theories, however, here, other accounts are offered in addition to these. These include theories of heuristics and theories from the behavior analysis domain, which may increase the predictive power of modeling bias, and have applications for how best to represent PH message information which minimize bias.",,Frontiers in Psychology,12,,0,,"['pub.1112068868', 'pub.1032458076', 'pub.1085211114', 'pub.1048303600', 'pub.1022267676', 'pub.1069641248', 'pub.1018226278', 'pub.1063905070', 'pub.1049353972', 'pub.1090366324', 'pub.1041691330', 'pub.1111419395', 'pub.1009530085', 'pub.1102393892', 'pub.1137882295', 'pub.1063991921', 'pub.1122254170', 'pub.1052421681', 'pub.1012327453', 'pub.1129512066', 'pub.1054887677', 'pub.1132819611', 'pub.1123641173', 'pub.1078543664', 'pub.1009295951', 'pub.1041506058', 'pub.1107888772', 'pub.1050142787', 'pub.1028066593', 'pub.1131095679', 'pub.1135539780', 'pub.1001016279', 'pub.1078542907', 'pub.1012289756', 'pub.1126724797', 'pub.1016444541', 'pub.1136339115', 'pub.1130654887', 'pub.1052867467', 'pub.1008019405', 'pub.1062646798', 'pub.1004785362', 'pub.1029473487', 'pub.1106524310', 'pub.1014490420', 'pub.1058847604', 'pub.1036671471', 'pub.1103971189', 'pub.1061100603', 'pub.1070052147', 'pub.1005529143', 'pub.1077622945', 'pub.1013702871', 'pub.1029885988', 'pub.1108957521', 'pub.1008089732', 'pub.1106159814', 'pub.1073707898', 'pub.1012764918', 'pub.1011787312', 'pub.1070970445', 'pub.1078381747', 'pub.1131339628', 'pub.1122868678', 'pub.1037836890', 'pub.1122064829', 'pub.1016246443', 'pub.1107272506', 'pub.1050575817', 'pub.1061806114', 'pub.1016511699', 'pub.1090388206', 'pub.1046947573', 'pub.1033571999', 'pub.1137017605', 'pub.1087941157', 'pub.1090370424', 'pub.1098665577', 'pub.1130101807', 'pub.1005096963', 'pub.1105446092', 'pub.1032537563', 'pub.1062805538', 'pub.1035065324', 'pub.1052071631', 'pub.1078542746', 'pub.1132394257', 'pub.1062510354', 'pub.1006934105', 'pub.1008794181', 'pub.1024758687', 'pub.1000192021', 'pub.1135653745', 'pub.1004275639', 'pub.1101559104', 'pub.1047847874', 'pub.1041153045', 'pub.1012096822', 'pub.1131892078', 'pub.1098832338', 'pub.1132119271', 'pub.1049631395', 'pub.1130635764', 'pub.1131361294', 'pub.1047508185', 'pub.1123646137', 'pub.1010859176', 'pub.1129259124', 'pub.1053106210', 'pub.1068844487', 'pub.1032575974', 'pub.1078351512', 'pub.1031834881', 'pub.1047537477', 'pub.1070837259', 'pub.1085956930', 'pub.1002818494', 'pub.1030216451', 'pub.1029501834', 'pub.1062489452', 'pub.1135779336', 'pub.1035648552', 'pub.1028540447']"

This includes the historical development of value in CSR, how value is linked to a positive vision of the future, and how it is communicated by a range of private and public organisations to various audiences. The book contrasts corporate strategic value with co-operative value, and community value in the context of sustainable development. It explains how leaders’ values can drive responsible business practice and enhance social cohesion, solidarity and resilience in fractured and unequal communities. The book asks the reader to consider what value means in CSR for business and society, where it comes from and how it is enacted, alongside its broader purpose and value to the community. Finally, the book presents CSR as a global project by noting how values are cultural and how sustainability has become an urgent international priority.",,"Palgrave Studies in Governance, Leadership and Responsibility",,,0,,

We propose a crisis mapping system that addresses limitations of current state-of-the-art approaches by analyzing the textual content of disaster reports from a twofold perspective. A damage detection component employs a SVM classifier to detect mentions of damage among emergency reports. A novel geoparsing technique is proposed and used to perform message geolocation. We report on a case study to show how the information extracted through damage detection and message geolocation can be combined to produce accurate crisis maps. Our crisis maps clearly detect both highly and lightly damaged areas, thus opening up the possibility to prioritize rescue efforts where they are most needed.","The authors would like to thank Matteo Abrate and Salvatore Rinzivillo, for their insightful suggestions about data visualization.

However, little is known about the neural bases underlying the social learning of a second language (L2) in adults. In this study, 36 adults were asked to learn two sets of L2 spoken words through translation versus simulated social interactive videos (social learning). Brain activation during word learning was measured using fMRI. Greater activation was observed in the bilateral superior temporal sulcus, posterior middle temporal gyri, and right inferior parietal lobule during social learning as compared with translation learning. Furthermore, higher activity in the right temporal parietal junction, right hippocampus, and motor areas was observed during the initial stage of social learning, with the more successful performance being at the time of overnight testing. We argue that social learning may strengthen the link from new L2 forms to rich L2 semantic representations wherein memory properties are embodied, multimodal, and richly contextualized.","HJ was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant of Japan (#18K00776).

Here, we study how people judge a set of controversial actions related to the crisis: relaxing data privacy standards to allow public control of the pandemic, forbidding public gatherings, denouncing a friend who violated COVID-19 protocols, prioritizing younger over older patients when medical resources are scarce, and reducing animal rights to accelerate vaccine development. We collected acceptability judgements in an initial large-scale study with participants from 10 Latin American countries (<i>N</i> = 15 420). A formal analysis of the intrinsic correlations between responses to different dilemmas revealed that judgements were organized in two dimensions: one that reflects a focus on human life expectancy and one that cares about the health of all sentient lives in an equitable manner. These stereotyped patterns of responses were stronger in people who endorsed utilitarian decisions in a standardized scale. A second pre-registered study performed in the USA (<i>N</i> = 1300) confirmed the replicability of these findings. Finally, we show how the prioritization of public health correlated with several contextual, personality and demographic factors. Overall, this research sheds light on the relationship between utilitarian decision-making and moral responses to the COVID-19 crisis.","We thank Victoria Milano, Rocco Di Tella, Juan Ignacio Cuile, Maria Agustina Nahas, Laura Gonzalez, Juan Manuel Garrido, Pablo Gonzalez, Nuria Caceres, Marco Sartorio and Lucia Freira for assistance with data collection.",Royal Society Open Science,8,9,1,,"['pub.1032821519', 'pub.1083827676', 'pub.1101390947', 'pub.1105249693', 'pub.1059418026', 'pub.1125461251', 'pub.1130108677', 'pub.1013822904', 'pub.1127155749', 'pub.1125804967', 'pub.1049377972', 'pub.1125825514', 'pub.1107801525', 'pub.1045068687', 'pub.1107561779', 'pub.1063740476', 'pub.1002562082', 'pub.1008281796', 'pub.1083687716', 'pub.1127442264', 'pub.1051664009', 'pub.1125942646', 'pub.1005518803', 'pub.1019068559', 'pub.1009356957', 'pub.1108780534', 'pub.1018809827', 'pub.1028270542', 'pub.1099939060', 'pub.1016726242', 'pub.1043807538', 'pub.1100320508', 'pub.1023467997', 'pub.1122780514', 'pub.1091233177', 'pub.1016242677', 'pub.1020605274', 'pub.1006417647', 'pub.1022172966', 'pub.1005126770', 'pub.1125942679', 'pub.1106907328', 'pub.1005138807', 'pub.1039130753', 'pub.1110929184']"

Fox Tree, Jyotsna Vaid",Frontiers,2022-01-18,10.3389/fsoc.2021.792198,pub.1144753196,"From its earliest beginnings, the university was not designed for women, and certainly not for women of color. Women of color in the United States are disproportionately under-represented in academia and are conspicuous by their absence across disciplines at senior ranks, particularly at research-intensive universities. This absence has an epistemic impact and affects future generations of scholars who do not see themselves represented in the academy. What are the barriers to attracting, advancing, and retaining women faculty of color in academia? To address this question we review empirical studies that document disparities in the assessment of research, teaching, and service in academia that have distinct implications for the hiring, promotion, and professional visibility of women of color. We argue that meaningful change in the representation, equity, and prestige of women faculty of color will require validating their experiences, supporting and valuing their research, creating opportunities for their professional recognition and advancement, and implementing corrective action for unjust assessment practices.",We thank the University of California Advancing Faculty Diversity Workgroup of 2020–2021 that helped to identify some of the papers included in this report and for discussion of some of the topics discussed here.

187,Grounded procedures: A proximate mechanism for the psychology of cleansing and other physical actions,"Spike W. S. Lee, Norbert Schwarz",Cambridge University Press (CUP),2020-05-11,10.1017/s0140525x20000308,pub.1127521522,"Experimental work has revealed causal links between physical cleansing and various psychological variables. Empirically, how robust are they? Theoretically, how do they operate? Major prevailing accounts focus on morality or disgust, capturing a subset of cleansing effects, but cannot easily handle cleansing effects in non-moral, non-disgusting contexts. Building on grounded views on cognitive processes and known properties of mental procedures, we propose grounded procedures of separation as a proximate mechanism underlying cleansing effects. This account differs from prevailing accounts in terms of explanatory kind, interpretive parsimony, and predictive scope. Its unique and falsifiable predictions have received empirical support: Cleansing attenuates or eliminates otherwise observed influences of prior events (1) across domains and (2) across valences. (3) Cleansing manipulations produce stronger effects the more strongly they engage sensorimotor capacities. (4) Reversing the causal arrow, motivation for cleansing is triggered more readily by negative than positive entities. (5) Conceptually similar effects extend to other physical actions of separation. On the flipside, grounded procedures of connection are also observed. Together, separation and connection organize prior findings relevant to multiple perspectives (e.g., conceptual metaphor, sympathetic magic) and open up new questions. Their predictions are more generalizable than the specific mappings in conceptual metaphors, but more fine-grained than the broad assumptions of grounded cognition. This intermediate level of analysis sheds light on the interplay between mental and physical processes.","The preparation of this paper was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SWSL, Insight Grant 435-2017-0127); the Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science (SWSL, Early Researcher Award – Round 13); the University of Toronto (SWSL, Connaught New Researcher Award 2014–2015); and the USC Dornsife Mind &amp; Society Center (NS).

188,Questioning Racial and Gender Bias in AI-based Recommendations: Do Espoused National Cultural Values Matter?,"Manjul Gupta, Carlos M.

Both media press and academic literature provide compelling evidence that AI-based recommendations help to perpetuate and exacerbate racial and gender biases. Yet, there is limited knowledge about the extent to which individuals might question AI-based recommendations when perceived as biased. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigate the effects of espoused national cultural values on AI questionability, by examining how individuals might question AI-based recommendations due to perceived racial or gender bias. Data collected from 387 survey respondents in the United States indicate that individuals with espoused national cultural values associated to collectivism, masculinity and uncertainty avoidance are more likely to question biased AI-based recommendations. This study advances understanding of how cultural values affect AI questionability due to perceived bias and it contributes to current academic discourse about the need to hold AI accountable.",,Information Systems Frontiers,,,3,,"['pub.1058714778', 'pub.1093104104', 'pub.1010893688', 'pub.1126827472', 'pub.1107307502', 'pub.1085995555', 'pub.1045155072', 'pub.1038448719', 'pub.1110909991', 'pub.1134316316', 'pub.1050710208', 'pub.1102515381', 'pub.1065004569', 'pub.1028510231', 'pub.1111334727', 'pub.1009129624', 'pub.1032938549', 'pub.1047548406', 'pub.1033436426', 'pub.1034010090', 'pub.1120725822', 'pub.1000491370', 'pub.1047688669', 'pub.1115446673', 'pub.1022972839', 'pub.1004881292', 'pub.1091265624', 'pub.1123608337', 'pub.1026256118', 'pub.1012816840', 'pub.1018937490', 'pub.1092810438', 'pub.1121371342', 'pub.1134275463', 'pub.1109866750', 'pub.1106197840', 'pub.1030785790', 'pub.1129555949', 'pub.1124148237', 'pub.1107046614', 'pub.1102515624', 'pub.1129555936', 'pub.1003655224', 'pub.1099659075', 'pub.1072618189', 'pub.1124918774', 'pub.1041839671', 'pub.1102515572', 'pub.1134829372', 'pub.1073400648', 'pub.1125904115', 'pub.1117678679', 'pub.1007400298', 'pub.1122916383', 'pub.1033318366', 'pub.1104473321', 'pub.1121106232', 'pub.1041386165', 'pub.1025559432', 'pub.1121431239', 'pub.1098690252', 'pub.1074125332', 'pub.1101623850', 'pub.1070371729', 'pub.1137670835', 'pub.1091891419', 'pub.1025079163', 'pub.1115523871', 'pub.1037798894', 'pub.1015421304', 'pub.1021058764', 'pub.1010824787', 'pub.1011522899', 'pub.1135100131', 'pub.1047286515', 'pub.1118105134', 'pub.1048828755', 'pub.1039418630', 'pub.1041674168', 'pub.1043784924', 'pub.1113364030', 'pub.1021260538', 'pub.1036793944', 'pub.1007645760', 'pub.1127670662', 'pub.1014446861', 'pub.1107240779', 'pub.1110762521', 'pub.1093408104', 'pub.1000624248', 'pub.1070002243', 'pub.1115957379', 'pub.1048526705']"
189,Conflict or Caveats? Effects of Media Portrayals of Scientific Uncertainty on Audience Perceptions of New Technologies,"Andrew R. Binder, Elliott D. Hillback, Dominique Brossard",Wiley,2015-08-13,10.1111/risa.12462,pub.1023691265,"Research indicates that uncertainty in science news stories affects public assessment of risk and uncertainty. However, the form in which uncertainty is presented may also affect people's risk and uncertainty assessments. For example, a news story that features an expert discussing both what is known and what is unknown about a topic may convey a different form of scientific uncertainty than a story that features two experts who hold conflicting opinions about the status of scientific knowledge of the topic, even when both stories contain the same information about knowledge and its boundaries. This study focuses on audience uncertainty and risk perceptions regarding the emerging science of nanotechnology by manipulating whether uncertainty in a news story about potential risks is attributed to expert sources in the form of caveats (individual uncertainty) or conflicting viewpoints (collective uncertainty). Results suggest that the type of uncertainty portrayed does not impact audience feelings of uncertainty or risk perceptions directly. Rather, the presentation of the story influences risk perceptions only among those who are highly deferent to scientific authority. Implications for risk communication theory and practice are discussed.

Rapp",American Psychological Association (APA),2021-04,10.1037/xlm0000977,pub.1132370162,"The current study investigated the role of metacognition with respect to the consequences of exposures to inaccurate information. Previous work has consistently demonstrated that exposures to inaccuracies can confuse people and even encourage reliance on the falsehoods. We specifically examined whether people are aware of their likelihood of being influenced by inaccurate information, and whether engaging in metacognitive reflection is effective at reducing this influence. In three experiments, participants read a story containing false assertions about the world. In Experiment 1, we compared participants' estimated resistance to inaccurate information against the degree to which their subsequent judgments actually reflected an influence of previously read inaccuracies. Participants were generally unaware of their susceptibility to inaccurate information, demonstrated by a lack of calibration between estimated and actual resistance. Their judgments consistently revealed an influence of previously read inaccuracies. In Experiment 2, we applied a metacognitive reflection task intended to encourage evaluation while reading. Participants who completed this task made fewer judgment errors after having read inaccurate statements than did participants who did not engage in reflection. Experiment 3 replicated these effects with a larger sample, and showed benefits of reflection for calibrations between people's estimated resistance and their actual performance. The accumulated findings highlight the importance of metacognitive considerations for understanding and addressing oft-reported, problematic effects of exposures to inaccuracies.

191,Using social media for vaccination promotion: Practices and challenges,"Maryke S Steffens, Adam G Dunn, Julie Leask, Kerrie E Wiley",SAGE Publications,2020-01,10.1177/2055207620970785,pub.1132302936,"Objective: Vaccination misinformation is widespread on social media. Vaccine-promoting organisations are working to curb its influence, but face obstacles. We aimed to analyse their social media strategies and the challenges they encounter.
Methods: In this qualitative study, we purposively sampled 21 participants responsible for social media from vaccine-promoting organisations. We used Framework Analysis to explore the data.
Results: Vaccine-promoting organisations faced obstacles using social media, including fast-paced change, limited resources, and insufficient organisational buy-in. They experienced difficulties reaching audiences, exploiting social media listening, and measuring impact. Consequently, they may miss opportunities to counter misinformation, connect with groups low in vaccine confidence, and determine diverse audience responses. They lack strong evidence linking social media strategies with behaviour change, and have difficulty understanding silent audiences.
Conclusions: Vaccine-promoting organisations have an opportunity to embrace the participatory nature of social media. They could share listening insights with like-minded groups, and conduct research exploring associations between social media strategies and community attitude/behaviour change. Social media platforms could assist by renewing vaccine-promoting organisations' organic reach, supporting the development of tailored listening and credibility tools, and strengthening collaborations to promote credible content.",N/A.,Digital Health,6,,8,,"['pub.1049659864', 'pub.1026985809', 'pub.1011823444', 'pub.1092250298', 'pub.1023817608', 'pub.1121091959', 'pub.1046583560', 'pub.1068264469', 'pub.1087792894', 'pub.1106189997', 'pub.1021552157', 'pub.1069286026', 'pub.1003725188', 'pub.1008391290', 'pub.1022237116', 'pub.1007455890', 'pub.1069286170', 'pub.1058399130', 'pub.1043995607', 'pub.1106686679', 'pub.1122790892', 'pub.1121999054', 'pub.1032282743', 'pub.1104611015', 'pub.1038880894', 'pub.1085154822', 'pub.1020156646', 'pub.1010242894', 'pub.1030538068', 'pub.1052924757', 'pub.1021112082', 'pub.1068264452', 'pub.1107667497']"
192,Relative Deprivation and Prosocial Tendencies in Chinese Migrant Children: Testing an Integrated Model of Perceived Social Support and Group Identity,"Meng Xiong, Lei Xiao, Yiduo Ye",Frontiers,2021-06-08,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.658007,pub.1138687750,"As a particularly vulnerable group, children from rural areas in China whose families migrate to urban areas often encounter social exclusion, prejudice, and discrimination as they adjust to city life. Hence, migrant children may experience a sense of relative deprivation when they feel they are treated unjustly when compared to their urban counterparts. Although previous research has demonstrated that relative deprivation is a risk factor for prosocial tendencies, this association has not yet been examined in the population of migrant children in China. Further, few studies have revealed the mediating and moderating mechanisms between relative deprivation and prosocial tendencies. Therefore, this study constructed an integrated model examining the possible mediating role of perceived social support and moderating role of in-group identity on the association between relative deprivation and prosocial tendencies. A large sample of 1,630 Chinese rural-to-urban migrant children (845 girls; <i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 12.30, <i>SD</i> = 1.74) completed a battery of self-report questionnaires regarding relative deprivation, prosocial tendencies, perceived social support, in-group identity, and demographic variables. The results indicated that relative deprivation was negatively correlated with migrant children's prosocial tendencies and this connection was partially mediated by perceived social support. Moderated mediation analysis further indicated that in-group identity moderated the effect of perceived social support on prosocial tendencies, with a high level of in-group identity strengthening the positive association between perceived social support and prosocial tendencies. Parents, educators, and other members of society concerned about migrant children's psychosocial adaptation should provide adequate social support resources and help them foster positive in-group identity to migrant populations to mitigate the adverse effects of relative deprivation and promote their prosocial tendencies.",We thank all of the primary school and junior high school students who participated in our study.

Its four sections focus on the conceptual foundations of participation, the implementation and instruments of democracy, examples from federal and regional States, and the emergence of participation on the European level. There is today a growing disaffection amongst the citizens of many states towards the traditional models of representative democracy. This book highlights the various functional and structural problems with which contemporary democracies are confronted and which lie at the root of their peoples’ discontent. Within multi-level systems in particular, the fragmentation of state authority generates feelings of powerlessness among citizens. In this context, citizens’ participation can in many cases be a useful complement to the representative and direct forms of democracy.",,,,,2,,

To understand the origins of this ability, we tested 48 32-month-old children (monolingual English, monolingual French, bilingual English-French; Study 1) and 16 adults (bilingual English-French; Study 2). Our design leveraged the distinct realizations of English (uh) versus French (euh) disfluencies. In a preferential-looking paradigm, participants saw familiar-novel object pairs (e.g., doll-rel), labeled in either Fluent (""Look at the doll/rel!""), Disfluent Language-consistent (""Look at thee uh doll/rel!""), or Disfluent Language-inconsistent (""Look at thee euh doll/rel!"") sentences. All participants looked more at the novel object when hearing disfluencies, irrespective of their phonetic realization. These results suggest that listeners from different language backgrounds harness disfluencies to comprehend day-to-day speech, possibly by attending to their lengthening as a signal of speaker uncertainty.

Contrary to a common narrative whereby politics drives susceptibility to fake news, people are 'better' at discerning truth from falsehood (despite greater overall belief) when evaluating politically concordant news. Instead, poor truth discernment is associated with lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge, and the use of heuristics such as familiarity. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, interventions can successfully nudge social media users to focus more on accuracy. Crowdsourced veracity ratings can also be leveraged to improve social media ranking algorithms.",,Trends in Cognitive Sciences,25,5,44,"['Communication', 'Deception', 'Humans', 'Politics', 'Problem Solving', 'Social Media']","['pub.1101164904', 'pub.1098729110', 'pub.1120878199', 'pub.1085470258', 'pub.1031268374', 'pub.1113953325', 'pub.1111650526', 'pub.1006849432', 'pub.1127425789', 'pub.1105724131', 'pub.1134199304', 'pub.1122055075', 'pub.1085319721', 'pub.1111580100', 'pub.1052766399', 'pub.1047724746', 'pub.1108504056', 'pub.1035348335', 'pub.1133568261', 'pub.1120695643', 'pub.1117070623', 'pub.1131383661', 'pub.1132161222', 'pub.1128313739', 'pub.1112472471', 'pub.1064525051', 'pub.1126992662', 'pub.1104335536', 'pub.1132508049', 'pub.1087979179', 'pub.1049436349', 'pub.1098574705', 'pub.1121091959', 'pub.1107236838', 'pub.1128718806', 'pub.1112584130', 'pub.1124656463', 'pub.1107188281', 'pub.1136442013', 'pub.1113480546', 'pub.1117478084', 'pub.1124929948', 'pub.1050493105', 'pub.1085183675', 'pub.1100424740', 'pub.1123826836', 'pub.1124481803', 'pub.1127313266', 'pub.1026575669', 'pub.1121160667', 'pub.1101380916', 'pub.1121152623', 'pub.1125934391', 'pub.1124768614', 'pub.1105010184', 'pub.1134853675', 'pub.1123777093', 'pub.1034764025', 'pub.1128884494', 'pub.1085467005', 'pub.1135291167', 'pub.1135141914', 'pub.1009157644', 'pub.1120665804', 'pub.1133227356', 'pub.1053118682', 'pub.1063964956', 'pub.1035602095', 'pub.1084197104', 'pub.1125504961', 'pub.1045448969', 'pub.1131477333', 'pub.1001234049', 'pub.1038436273', 'pub.1108042970', 'pub.1127963010', 'pub.1113474640', 'pub.1111564889', 'pub.1135169674', 'pub.1117867660', 'pub.1009941445', 'pub.1134436360', 'pub.1101714686', 'pub.1037655062', 'pub.1122816952', 'pub.1128674975', 'pub.1091661990', 'pub.1046076925', 'pub.1084152783', 'pub.1130316085', 'pub.1130482599', 'pub.1044459543', 'pub.1135285293', 'pub.1125314324', 'pub.1044669833', 'pub.1125057272', 'pub.1107799556', 'pub.1001980645', 'pub.1120384147', 'pub.1122118050', 'pub.1017834924', 'pub.1091623818', 'pub.1123960880', 'pub.1113155690', 'pub.1127794863', 'pub.1109782746', 'pub.1105496536', 'pub.1120145658', 'pub.1090427219', 'pub.1128239885', 'pub.1112785383', 'pub.1111339861', 'pub.1126993152', 'pub.1131319352', 'pub.1091807455', 'pub.1033467594', 'pub.1105724107', 'pub.1111751640', 'pub.1132370162', 'pub.1131097498', 'pub.1129656298', 'pub.1017686128', 'pub.1111308730']"

In our interviews with surrogate mothers, intended parents, and surrogacy professionals, we traced the meanings and ideologies through which they understood the clinical labour of surrogacy. We found that in the US, interviewed surrogates, intended parents and professionals understood surrogacy as an exchange of both gifts and commodities, where gift-giving, reciprocity, and relatedness between surrogates and intended parents were the major tropes. In India, differing narratives of surrogacy were offered by its different parties: whilst professionals and intended parents framed it as a win-win exchange with an emphasis on the economic side, the interviewed surrogate mothers talked about surrogacy as creative labour of giving life. In Russia, approaches to surrogacy among the interviewed surrogate mothers, professionals and intended parents overlapped in framing it as work and a businesslike commodity exchange.

We name them ""repro-regional moral frameworks"", inspired by earlier work on moral frameworks as well as on reproductive nationalisms and transnational reproduction.

207,Translating striatal activity from brain slice to whole animal neurophysiology: A guide for neuroscience research integrating diverse levels of analysis,Howard Casey Cromwell,Wiley,2019-06-30,10.1002/jnr.24480,pub.1117651928,"An important goal of this review is highlighting research in neuroscience as examples of multilevel functional and anatomical analyses addressing basic science issues and applying results to the understanding of diverse disorders. The research of Dr. Michael Levine, a leader in neuroscience, exemplifies this approach by uncovering fundamental properties of basal ganglia function and translating these findings to clinical applications. The review focuses on neurophysiological research connecting results from in vitro and in vivo recordings. A second goal is to utilize these research connections to produce novel, accurate descriptions for corticostriatal processing involved in varied, complex functions. Medium spiny neurons in striatum act as integrators combining input with baseline activity creating motivational ""events."" Basic research on corticostriatal synapses is described and links developed to issues with clinical relevance such as inhibitory gating, self-injurious behavior, and relative reward valuation. Work is highlighted on dopamine-glutamate interactions. Individual medium spiny neurons express both D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors and encode information in a bivalent manner depending upon the mix of receptors involved. Current work on neurophysiology of reward processing has taken advantage of these basic approaches at the cellular and molecular levels. Future directions in studying physiology of reward processing and action sequencing could profit by incorporating the divergent ways dopamine modulates incoming neurochemical signals. Primary investigators leading research teams should mirror Mike Levine's efforts in ""climbing the mountain"" of scientific inquiry by performing analyses at different levels of inquiry, integrating the findings, and building comprehensive answers to problems unsolvable without this bold approach.","The manuscript is dedicated to Robert “Mojave Bob” Koelling who was behind the scenes as the senior laboratory manager for the bulk of the research described in this review.

215,Recovering the Relational Starting Point of Compassion Training: A Foundation for Sustainable and Inclusive Care,"Paul Condon, John Makransky",SAGE Publications,2020-08-03,10.1177/1745691620922200,pub.1129853638,"The cultivation of compassion through meditation training is of increasing interest to scientists, health-care providers, educators, and policymakers as an approach to help address challenging personal and social issues. Yet people encounter critical inner psychological barriers to compassion that limit the effectiveness of compassion training-including the lack of a secure base, aversion to suffering, feeling alone in suffering, and reductive impressions of others. These barriers emerge, in part, from a lack of relational support and are exacerbated by modernist conceptions that present meditation as an autonomous, self-help practice. This article proposes a solution centered on relationality that is derived from the integration of diverse areas of psychology with contemplative traditions. Theories and findings from social, developmental, and health psychology can inform meditation programs and help recover important relational elements of compassion training from traditional cultures that address common barriers to compassion and thus promote more sustainable and inclusive care. In so doing, this article illustrates the value of psychological theories for translating important contextual elements from contemplative traditions into diverse modern settings.","We thank Gaëlle Desbordes, Andy Dreitcer, Lisa Flook, June Gruber, Kent Hoffman, Ana Hristic’, Molly Kretchmar-Hendricks, Dan Lim, Brian Robinette, Jessie Stern, and two anonymous reviewers for input on an earlier version of the manuscript for this article.",Perspectives on Psychological Science,15,6,5,"['Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Meditation', 'Research Personnel', 'School Teachers', 'Teacher Training']","['pub.1044799227', 'pub.1035566854', 'pub.1016341544', 'pub.1014199304', 'pub.1105980886', 'pub.1004364138', 'pub.1101083386', 'pub.1021691160', 'pub.1030030854', 'pub.1002273493', 'pub.1050213944', 'pub.1019502923', 'pub.1008126143', 'pub.1016124596', 'pub.1037937611', 'pub.1041933593', 'pub.1023335727', 'pub.1107723458', 'pub.1090090455', 'pub.1107434637', 'pub.1016605082', 'pub.1029969102', 'pub.1033581366', 'pub.1107846446', 'pub.1011002240', 'pub.1067630169', 'pub.1039042904', 'pub.1026292752', 'pub.1044696954', 'pub.1001977301', 'pub.1086050573', 'pub.1053149303', 'pub.1063904726', 'pub.1113534571', 'pub.1050090523', 'pub.1054886710', 'pub.1000778713', 'pub.1110366923', 'pub.1010806371', 'pub.1011297055', 'pub.1003363431', 'pub.1025654995', 'pub.1001190435', 'pub.1018962114', 'pub.1111476501', 'pub.1005641816', 'pub.1050051347', 'pub.1003662608', 'pub.1120336806', 'pub.1050638404', 'pub.1024605833', 'pub.1073707447', 'pub.1124769132', 'pub.1015704515', 'pub.1022230928', 'pub.1101539265', 'pub.1010132127', 'pub.1110581670', 'pub.1053456324', 'pub.1130758004', 'pub.1100010073', 'pub.1034039780', 'pub.1014321340', 'pub.1004870339', 'pub.1014706757', 'pub.1009166978', 'pub.1007948993', 'pub.1113140804', 'pub.1042386627', 'pub.1026705773', 'pub.1042575458', 'pub.1030360962', 'pub.1000047068', 'pub.1008238023', 'pub.1030496001', 'pub.1112541856', 'pub.1101373694', 'pub.1012115181', 'pub.1047069313', 'pub.1014076063', 'pub.1051064307', 'pub.1123423037', 'pub.1045717178', 'pub.1018409357', 'pub.1030663252', 'pub.1033218355', 'pub.1004099564', 'pub.1009013888', 'pub.1018623546', 'pub.1024682651', 'pub.1036232352', 'pub.1106511941', 'pub.1023309710', 'pub.1006088991', 'pub.1005750542', 'pub.1043886322', 'pub.1096909892']"
216,"Effects of minimal grouping on implicit prejudice, infrahumanization, and neural processing despite orthogonal social categorizations","Jeremy C. Simon, Jennifer N. Gutsell",SAGE Publications,2019-05-06,10.1177/1368430219837348,pub.1113968207,"Racial prejudice is a pervasive and pernicious form of intergroup bias. However, a mounting number of studies show that re-categorization-even into minimal groups-can overcome the typical consequences of racial and other group classifications. We tested the effects of minimal grouping on implicit prejudice and infrahumanization using a paradigm in which race was orthogonal to group membership. This allowed us to examine whether knowledge of group membership overrides obvious category differences. We found that participants infrahumanized and showed implicit bias toward the minimal out-group, despite the crosscutting presence of race, and in fact did not show any of the usual implicit racial bias. In addition, Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) showed an early race effect followed by distinct reactions on the basis of group as processing continued. This is evidence that arbitrary social classifications can engender in-group preference even in the presence of orthogonal, visually salient categorizations.","We would like to thank Jay Van Bavel and Stéphanie Demoulin for their materials and advice; Leslie Zebrowitz for her comments on a draft of the manuscript; John Ksander and Yanyi Jiang for technical support; and Omar Igeh, Mai Le, and Amanda Zhou for their assistance with data collection.",Group Processes & Intergroup Relations,23,3,6,,"['pub.1010926018', 'pub.1001768593', 'pub.1027473383', 'pub.1106351919', 'pub.1014787768', 'pub.1010973133', 'pub.1035419964', 'pub.1035495385', 'pub.1045962671', 'pub.1014624636', 'pub.1053145162', 'pub.1027698729', 'pub.1053452916', 'pub.1052001959', 'pub.1037134073', 'pub.1031885113', 'pub.1052571456', 'pub.1001431894', 'pub.1037564550', 'pub.1002936618', 'pub.1067636489', 'pub.1048024530', 'pub.1049650371', 'pub.1041144436', 'pub.1001400014', 'pub.1022629264', 'pub.1049295575', 'pub.1016957274', 'pub.1028365073', 'pub.1007385585', 'pub.1107903030', 'pub.1005970425', 'pub.1005415554', 'pub.1052460158', 'pub.1056343171', 'pub.1042384315', 'pub.1026146387', 'pub.1052479395', 'pub.1007470716', 'pub.1039934963', 'pub.1011101224', 'pub.1064218657', 'pub.1041727108', 'pub.1045311486', 'pub.1021880123', 'pub.1014027219', 'pub.1035613449', 'pub.1040316448', 'pub.1035547438', 'pub.1016642409', 'pub.1047246297', 'pub.1053128731', 'pub.1063740912', 'pub.1024197384', 'pub.1035710213', 'pub.1012435848', 'pub.1015305017', 'pub.1005929158', 'pub.1041455034', 'pub.1008899393', 'pub.1053151830', 'pub.1021862228', 'pub.1009039288', 'pub.1029545631', 'pub.1022692574', 'pub.1050824864', 'pub.1013807201', 'pub.1050120507', 'pub.1038236542', 'pub.1020994457', 'pub.1035161816', 'pub.1022689479', 'pub.1013580221', 'pub.1000977060', 'pub.1009671026', 'pub.1018481215', 'pub.1003174463', 'pub.1015321135', 'pub.1018623546', 'pub.1040163860', 'pub.1033839115', 'pub.1000229240', 'pub.1034736171', 'pub.1000006764', 'pub.1034681355']"

Rather than rehashing old debates or longingly gazing at the past, this book presents sociologists with new ways of conceptualizing the organization and presentation of sociological theory. At the heart of this Handbook’s vision is the twin goals of making theory a viable enterprise by reconceptualizing how we teach theory and keeping theory closely tied to its empirical applications. Three strategies are offered: (1) Elucidating how classic issues like integration or interaction are interrogated today; (2) Presenting a coherent vision of the social levels of reality that theorists work on such as communities, groups, and the self as well as how the coherence of these levels speaks to the macro-micro link; and, (3) Theorizing the social world rather than celebrating theorists or theories; that is, one can look at how theory is used holistically to understand the constraints the social world places on our lived experience or the dynamics of social change. Hence, in the second decade of the 21st century, it has become clear that sociology is at a crossroads as the number of theorists and amount of theory available is increasingly unmanageable and unknowable by the vast majority of professionals and students. As such, this Handbook of Contemporary Sociological Theory presents the novice and the expert with the a roadmap for traversing this crossroad and building a more coherent, robust, and cumulative sociology.",,Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research,,,15,,

Although people get much of their information online, some of the Internet news is questionable and even deceptively presented. It is harder to distinguish fake news from the real news as it is sent about in order to trick readers into believing fabricated information, making it increasingly difficult for detection algorithms to identify fake news based on the material that is shared. As a result, an urgent demand for machine learning (ML), deep learning, and artificial intelligence models that can recognize fake news arises. The linguistic characteristics of the news provide a simple method for detecting false news, which the reader does not need to have any additional knowledge to make use of. We discovered that NLP techniques and text-based word vector representation may successfully predict fabricated news using a machine learning approach. In this paper, on datasets containing false and genuine news, we assessed the performance of six machine learning models. We evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,13116,,0,,"['pub.1130130254', 'pub.1113720830', 'pub.1096025772', 'pub.1136254159', 'pub.1123770917', 'pub.1104410756', 'pub.1046423247', 'pub.1121836629', 'pub.1128186721', 'pub.1140935213', 'pub.1101382661', 'pub.1121835183', 'pub.1134295114', 'pub.1133341840', 'pub.1112872294', 'pub.1134346331', 'pub.1138538589', 'pub.1126724525', 'pub.1091623818', 'pub.1140846445', 'pub.1125119024', 'pub.1100885484', 'pub.1129113018', 'pub.1027966195', 'pub.1123212015', 'pub.1129079101', 'pub.1135083983']"

While much research focuses on understanding the role of personality-level traits for those who share the news, such as partisanship and analytic thinking, characteristics of the articles themselves have not been studied. Across two pre-registered studies, we examined whether character-deprecation headlines - headlines designed to deprecate someone's character, but which have no impact on policy or legislation - increased the likelihood of self-reported sharing on social media. In Study 1 we harvested fake news items from online sources and compared sharing intentions between Republicans and Democrats. Results showed that, compared to Democrats, Republicans had greater intention to share character-deprecation headlines compared to news with policy implications. We then applied these findings experimentally. In Study 2 we developed a set of fake news items that was matched for content across pro-Democratic and pro-Republican headlines and across news focusing on a specific person (e.g., <i>Trump</i>) versus a generic person (e.g., <i>a Republican</i>). We found that, contrary to Study 1, Republicans were no more inclined toward character deprecation than Democrats. However, these findings suggest that while character assassination may be a feature of pro-Republican news, it is not more attractive to Republicans versus Democrats. News with policy implications, whether fake or real, seems consistently more attractive to members of both parties regardless of whether it attempts to deprecate an opponent's character. Thus, character deprecation in fake news may in be in supply, but not in demand.",,Group Processes & Intergroup Relations,24,4,2,,"['pub.1111788955', 'pub.1128884494', 'pub.1124797127', 'pub.1107799556', 'pub.1120691079', 'pub.1120384147', 'pub.1125748361', 'pub.1107188281', 'pub.1123960880', 'pub.1111650526', 'pub.1113155690', 'pub.1091450204', 'pub.1117478084', 'pub.1112072550', 'pub.1085319721', 'pub.1126716940', 'pub.1126123252', 'pub.1123826836', 'pub.1035348335', 'pub.1124028507', 'pub.1123698595', 'pub.1126992089', 'pub.1009990026', 'pub.1125450609', 'pub.1101382661', 'pub.1101380916', 'pub.1124583173', 'pub.1122816952', 'pub.1038097502', 'pub.1111751640', 'pub.1126995346', 'pub.1124768614', 'pub.1105010184', 'pub.1017715853', 'pub.1101226804', 'pub.1049436349', 'pub.1111308730']"

This information can be valuable for those interested in how people react to emergent events, including researchers, governments, and policy makers.",The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,16,12,0,"['COVID-19', 'Communication', 'Humans', 'Social Media']","['pub.1128884494', 'pub.1128172079', 'pub.1128872573', 'pub.1126107934', 'pub.1018146409', 'pub.1099117426', 'pub.1131158082', 'pub.1114021220', 'pub.1006878651', 'pub.1134629586', 'pub.1128294077', 'pub.1048257431', 'pub.1129937664', 'pub.1132036734', 'pub.1127536914', 'pub.1134903207', 'pub.1068672607', 'pub.1103631676', 'pub.1136050442', 'pub.1126880699', 'pub.1127930166', 'pub.1099237519', 'pub.1014705456', 'pub.1105831290', 'pub.1009402100', 'pub.1100623382', 'pub.1019322299', 'pub.1128950196', 'pub.1129359513', 'pub.1128371009', 'pub.1037240598', 'pub.1134731742', 'pub.1091513457', 'pub.1130874363', 'pub.1126724088', 'pub.1128563984', 'pub.1025300401', 'pub.1132666754', 'pub.1126734151', 'pub.1009096330', 'pub.1123642350', 'pub.1132137765', 'pub.1126574216', 'pub.1103871738', 'pub.1091240631', 'pub.1131315779', 'pub.1033051870', 'pub.1130895909', 'pub.1134278371', 'pub.1011996213']"
224,Enhancing Social Connectedness in Anxiety and Depression Through Amplification of Positivity: Preliminary Treatment Outcomes and Process of Change,"Charles T. Taylor, Sarah L. Pearlstein, Sanskruti Kakaria, Sonja Lyubomirsky, Murray B. Stein",Springer Nature,2020-04-19,10.1007/s10608-020-10102-7,pub.1126807922,"BackgroundAnxiety and depressive disorders are often characterized by perceived social disconnection, yet evidence-based treatments produce only modest improvements in this domain. The well-established link between positive affect (PA) and social connectedness suggests that directly targeting PA in treatment may be valuable.MethodA secondary analysis of a waitlist-controlled trial (N = 29) was conducted to evaluate treatment response and process of change in social connectedness within a 10-session positive activity intervention protocol—Amplification of Positivity (AMP)—designed to increase PA in individuals seeking treatment for anxiety or depression (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02330627). Perceived social connectedness and PA/negative affect (NA) were assessed throughout treatment. Time-lagged multilevel mediation models examined the process of change in affect and connectedness throughout treatment.ResultsThe AMP group displayed significantly larger improvements in social connectedness from pre- to post-treatment compared to waitlist; improvements were maintained through 6-month follow-up. Within the AMP group, increases in PA and decreases in NA both uniquely predicted subsequent increases in connectedness throughout treatment. However, experiencing heightened NA throughout treatment attenuated the effect of changes in PA on connectedness. Improvements in connectedness predicted subsequent increases in PA, but not changes in NA.ConclusionsThese preliminary findings suggest that positive activity interventions may be valuable for enhancing social connectedness in individuals with clinically impairing anxiety or depression, possibly through both increasing positive emotions and decreasing negative emotions.",,Cognitive Therapy and Research,44,4,13,,"['pub.1008973418', 'pub.1042165870', 'pub.1072210176', 'pub.1050604316', 'pub.1010857623', 'pub.1035355985', 'pub.1028911898', 'pub.1117939794', 'pub.1000956279', 'pub.1105149133', 'pub.1037366954', 'pub.1043447588', 'pub.1041684481', 'pub.1016078326', 'pub.1028607882', 'pub.1033221875', 'pub.1004618968', 'pub.1117503141', 'pub.1030992603', 'pub.1007948993', 'pub.1006622577', 'pub.1029436066', 'pub.1104329124', 'pub.1042015452', 'pub.1084084930', 'pub.1000939714', 'pub.1021132850', 'pub.1043976851', 'pub.1085991337', 'pub.1006251193', 'pub.1023022926', 'pub.1000679387', 'pub.1100773611', 'pub.1053756928', 'pub.1002964461', 'pub.1046371443', 'pub.1124052697', 'pub.1009874343', 'pub.1011412336', 'pub.1031907370', 'pub.1023698155', 'pub.1037900491', 'pub.1012083256', 'pub.1004206500', 'pub.1051840286', 'pub.1023263752', 'pub.1013991981', 'pub.1067630534', 'pub.1004667820', 'pub.1041071790', 'pub.1008446881', 'pub.1002252030', 'pub.1042201178', 'pub.1077226902', 'pub.1046638555', 'pub.1053304197', 'pub.1045687490', 'pub.1015006809', 'pub.1011556784', 'pub.1037140636', 'pub.1004406704', 'pub.1006345487', 'pub.1032985331', 'pub.1024309326', 'pub.1030809049', 'pub.1113534581', 'pub.1035511367', 'pub.1013335753', 'pub.1048271937', 'pub.1039991288', 'pub.1112403159', 'pub.1010198382', 'pub.1040220011', 'pub.1049340636', 'pub.1005073989', 'pub.1000642493', 'pub.1031975795', 'pub.1033169736', 'pub.1031881889', 'pub.1003590277', 'pub.1029115482', 'pub.1032443528', 'pub.1112108987', 'pub.1023353192', 'pub.1015743147', 'pub.1005732758', 'pub.1046167092', 'pub.1122397478', 'pub.1090943105', 'pub.1007210483', 'pub.1014851818', 'pub.1031124168']"
225,The relative contribution of parenting practices in predicting trait emotional intelligence in an Italian adolescent sample,"Maria C. Gugliandolo, Stella Mavroveli, Sebastiano Costa, Francesca Cuzzocrea, Rosalba Larcan",Wiley,2019-08-30,10.1111/bjdp.12299,pub.1120687690,"This study examines the relationship between trait emotional intelligence (trait EI), support, and parental psychological control practices. Three hundred adolescents, between 11 and 13 years old, took part in the study (163 were males and 137 were females). Participants completed the Perceptions of Parents Scales for the parental support, the Dependency (DPC)- and Achievement (APC)-oriented Psychological Control Scales for the parental psychological control, and the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Child Form for the child's trait EI. Trait EI was related to parenting variables, and also, parental practices (both support and psychological control) predicted global trait EI in adolescents. Some gender-specific differences were found: both APC and DPC were negative predictors of trait EI in males, whereas only APC significantly predicted trait EI in females. Future longitudinal studies are needed to examine these results and to shed light on the processes involved in the development of trait EI. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on the subject? There exists strong evidence of the interaction between parenting practices and emotional development in children and adolescents. Therefore, parental psychological control is negatively correlated with peer support and self-esteem, and positively related to anxiety and aggressive behaviour in children. However, there is paucity on research examining the relationship between parenting and trait EI in children. What does this study adds? This study extends earlier work in this field and investigates whether there is a relationship between trait EI and parenting practices (parental support and psychological control) and whether it depends on child and parent gender. This study, therefore, aims to investigate, for the first time, parental factors that may, in addition to those constitutional, be related to trait EI in children. Specifically, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether parenting practices would predict adolescents' trait EI and whether these relations depend on the gender.",,British Journal of Developmental Psychology,37,4,7,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Emotional Intelligence', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parenting', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Perception', 'Social Support']","['pub.1051209255', 'pub.1053178412', 'pub.1130082439', 'pub.1020710497', 'pub.1008341839', 'pub.1046458515', 'pub.1027249819', 'pub.1051136159', 'pub.1009688949', 'pub.1063950302', 'pub.1009394561', 'pub.1110685728', 'pub.1032771171', 'pub.1031474897', 'pub.1024539106', 'pub.1024053812', 'pub.1042343307', 'pub.1014091556', 'pub.1026874627', 'pub.1129269870', 'pub.1106582372', 'pub.1014399468', 'pub.1009698918', 'pub.1029014624', 'pub.1036101684', 'pub.1108427052', 'pub.1018678498', 'pub.1017443079', 'pub.1022032206', 'pub.1021048297', 'pub.1047291546', 'pub.1046640628', 'pub.1047970823', 'pub.1024197314', 'pub.1028035177', 'pub.1036089363', 'pub.1008707650', 'pub.1092114982', 'pub.1105910853', 'pub.1009151919', 'pub.1064219137', 'pub.1109721251', 'pub.1058306889', 'pub.1004383669', 'pub.1013237395', 'pub.1038028266', 'pub.1032603767', 'pub.1085743884', 'pub.1063843360', 'pub.1053338143', 'pub.1028367705', 'pub.1017839121', 'pub.1047962852', 'pub.1052118030', 'pub.1001101888', 'pub.1038275440', 'pub.1024960208']"

How to boost customer demand by improving their purchase intention has become a key issue. The study identified the critical conditions leading to high purchase intention of fruits through fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. The empirical analysis was conducted based on an online questionnaire of 344 Internet users. The results reveal that high purchase intention comes from high fruit quality, high fruit price concessions and supply service, and low perceived risk (peripheral conditions).

228,Analysis of the applicability and utility of a gamified didactics with exergames at primary schools: Qualitative findings from a natural experiment,"Alejandro Quintas-Hijós, Carlos Peñarrubia-Lozano, Juan Carlos Bustamante",Public Library of Science (PLoS),2020-04-10,10.1371/journal.pone.0231269,pub.1126585030,"One of the main objectives of Physical Education in elementary schools is to encourage motivation so that the subject enhances academic performance and the practice of physical exercise. Didactic research should evaluate the effectiveness of educational methods to know if they are applicable, useful, and in what sense. Exergames are digital motor games that aim to stimulate players' motor skills. Gamification refers to the use of game-based elements in nongame contexts to motivate actions. This research evaluates a gamified exergaming intervention, designed to improve children's academic performance by focusing on understanding applicability and usefulness. A natural experiment was set up in schools according to a mixed methods design. The qualitative data herein reported were collected during a natural experiment with a nonrandomized controlled design. The qualitative research design was used with field notes, an open-questions questionnaire, individual semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews. Eight teachers and 417 students took part. A content analysis was chosen as the methodological orientation. The facilitators were the realism of their didactic design and their adaptability to different educational contexts. The main barriers were the required materials and facilities. Teachers and students' attitudes were very positive, although future use was inconclusive. These findings may imply that this study is one of the few to provide positive evidence for educational gamification. The ""Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics"" gamification model and the ""Just Dance Now"" exergame may be applicable and useful for didactics in Physical Education, but all the participants' suggestions need to be considered to improve teaching interventions.","This research has been supported by Grants received by JCB from the Fundación Hergar (2018/0081) (https://www.fundacionhergar.org/), from the Fundación Bancaria Ibercaja (JIUZ-2017-SOC-06) (https://www.fundacionibercaja.es/), and from FEDER (Programa Operativo 2014-2020) and the Regional Aragón Government (INFR2016_UZ_SOC_05) (https://www.aragon.es/-/feder-fondos-fondos-europeos-gobierno-de-aragon).

Games are a powerful tool to identify the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying interpersonal and group cooperation and coordination. Here we discuss recent developments in how experimental games are used and adapted, with an increased focus on repeated interactions, partner control through sanctioning, and partner (de)selection for future interactions. Important advances have been made in uncovering the neurobiological underpinnings of key factors involved in cooperation and coordination, including social preferences, cooperative beliefs, (emotion) signaling, and, in particular, reputations and (in)direct reciprocity.

233,Disinformation and the Structural Transformations of the Public Arena: Addressing the Actual Challenges to Democracy,"Andreas Jungherr, Ralph Schroeder",SAGE Publications,2021-01-21,10.1177/2056305121988928,pub.1134810889,"Current debate is dominated by fears of the threats of digital technology for democracy. One typical example is the perceived threats of malicious actors promoting disinformation through digital channels to sow confusion and exacerbate political divisions. The prominence of the threat of digital disinformation in the public imagination, however, is not supported by empirical findings which instead indicate that disinformation is a limited problem with limited reach among the public. Its prominence in public discourse is instead best understood as a “moral panic.” In this article, we argue that we should shift attention from these evocative but empirically marginal phenomena of deviance connected with digital media toward the structural transformations that give rise to these fears, namely those that have impacted information flows and attention allocation in the public arena. This account centers on structural transformations of the public arena and associated new challenges, especially in relation to gatekeepers, old and new. How the public arena serves actually existing democracy will not be addressed by focusing on disinformation, but rather by addressing structural transformations and the new challenges that arise from these.","We want to thank the Bayerisches Forschungsinstitut für Digitale Transformation (bidt) for giving us the opportunity to develop the foundations of the argument presented here in a keynote at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Munich.

235,(Mis)informed about what? What it means to be a science-literate citizen in a digital world,"Emily L. Howell, Dominique Brossard",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2021-04-05,10.1073/pnas.1912436117,pub.1136931741,"Science literacy is often held up as crucial for avoiding science-related misinformation and enabling more informed individual and collective decision-making. But research has not yet examined whether science literacy actually enables this, nor what skills it would need to encompass to do so. In this report, we address three questions to outline what it should mean to be science literate in today's world: 1) How should we conceptualize science literacy? 2) How can we achieve this science literacy? and 3) What can we expect science literacy's most important outcomes to be? If science literacy is to truly enable people to become and stay informed (and avoid being misinformed) on complex science issues, it requires skills that span the ""lifecycle"" of science information. This includes how the scientific community produces science information, how media repackage and share the information, and how individuals encounter and form opinions on this information. Science literacy, then, is best conceptualized as encompassing three dimensions of literacy spanning the lifecycle: Civic science literacy, digital media science literacy, and cognitive science literacy. Achieving such science literacy, particularly for adults, poses many challenges and will likely require a structural perspective. Digital divides, in particular, are a major structural barrier, and community literacy and building science literacy into media and science communication are promising opportunities. We end with a discussion of what some of the beneficial outcomes could be-and, as importantly, will likely not be-of science literacy that furthers informed and critical engagement with science in democratic society.",,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,118,15,5,"['Deception', 'Health Communication', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Literacy', 'Humans', 'Internet']","['pub.1032866731', 'pub.1033598361', 'pub.1053501019', 'pub.1059120457', 'pub.1037839941', 'pub.1001770363', 'pub.1085537677', 'pub.1003317453', 'pub.1015192379', 'pub.1092094578', 'pub.1005679602', 'pub.1053419736', 'pub.1070967648', 'pub.1100559664', 'pub.1017671594', 'pub.1010614422', 'pub.1124437929', 'pub.1092500445', 'pub.1053233917', 'pub.1126894983', 'pub.1031966585', 'pub.1106483321', 'pub.1047635157', 'pub.1044852112', 'pub.1108645513', 'pub.1013974149', 'pub.1074211439', 'pub.1034611385', 'pub.1024614132', 'pub.1041444891', 'pub.1128674975', 'pub.1013528980', 'pub.1112075009', 'pub.1040386477', 'pub.1050380742', 'pub.1008484232', 'pub.1034266650', 'pub.1103859245', 'pub.1115990339', 'pub.1105754201', 'pub.1024718229', 'pub.1022982589', 'pub.1015758396', 'pub.1050120445', 'pub.1022732805', 'pub.1062467859', 'pub.1131575684']"
236,Current approaches to terrorist and violent extremist content among the global top 50 online content-sharing services,OECD,,2020-08-14,10.1787/68058b95-en,pub.1130156334,"This report provides an overview of the policies and procedures for addressing terrorist and violent extremist content (TVEC) across the global top 50 online content sharing services, with a focus on transparency. It finds that only five of the 50 services issue transparency reports specifically about TVEC, and these five services take different approaches in their reports. These services use different definitions of terrorism and violent extremism, report different types of information, use different measurement and estimation methods, and issue reports with varying frequency and on different timetables. The low number of reporting companies and the variation in what, when and how they report make it impossible to get a clear and complete cross-industry perspective on the efficacy of companies’ measures to combat TVEC online and how they may affect human rights. This situation could be improved if more companies issued TVEC transparency reports and included more comparable information.",,,,,0,,
237,How Microbial Food Web Interactions Shape the Arctic Ocean Bacterial Community Revealed by Size Fractionation Experiments,"Oliver Müller, Lena Seuthe, Bernadette Pree, Gunnar Bratbak, Aud Larsen, Maria Lund Paulsen",MDPI,2021-11-17,10.3390/microorganisms9112378,pub.1143280311,"In the Arctic, seasonal changes are substantial, and as a result, the marine bacterial community composition and functions differ greatly between the dark winter and light-intensive summer. While light availability is, overall, the external driver of the seasonal changes, several internal biological interactions structure the bacterial community during shorter timescales. These include specific phytoplankton-bacteria associations, viral infections and other top-down controls. Here, we uncover these microbial interactions and their effects on the bacterial community composition during a full annual cycle by manipulating the microbial food web using size fractionation. The most profound community changes were detected during the spring, with 'mutualistic phytoplankton'-Gammaproteobacteria interactions dominating in the pre-bloom phase and 'substrate-dependent phytoplankton'-Flavobacteria interactions during blooming conditions. Bacterivores had an overall limited effect on the bacterial community composition most of the year. However, in the late summer, grazing was the main factor shaping the community composition and transferring carbon to higher trophic levels. Identifying these small-scale interactions improves our understanding of the Arctic marine microbial food web and its dynamics.",We would like to thank the crew members of the Norwegian Research Vessels RV Helmer Hanssen and RV Lance for their assistance in the sampling expeditions and all colleagues in the UiB Marine Microbiology group and collaborators abroad who contributed to the research effort.,Microorganisms,9,11,0,,"['pub.1000605215', 'pub.1105452027', 'pub.1084806743', 'pub.1083369382', 'pub.1044857293', 'pub.1071164706', 'pub.1001816442', 'pub.1034489174', 'pub.1071280932', 'pub.1019627885', 'pub.1084608038', 'pub.1040879904', 'pub.1014847973', 'pub.1008340066', 'pub.1025159153', 'pub.1032476702', 'pub.1019105648', 'pub.1120136591', 'pub.1030680131', 'pub.1137188220', 'pub.1034259503', 'pub.1131156110', 'pub.1110359479', 'pub.1104396956', 'pub.1037909650', 'pub.1069435621', 'pub.1042783196', 'pub.1136790164', 'pub.1110447149', 'pub.1046639452', 'pub.1071157718', 'pub.1053065277', 'pub.1052618751', 'pub.1077158869', 'pub.1071173966', 'pub.1131843448', 'pub.1100561324', 'pub.1030104734', 'pub.1012629569', 'pub.1103794139', 'pub.1046443759', 'pub.1054809504', 'pub.1010656665', 'pub.1049191000', 'pub.1001521131', 'pub.1051344732', 'pub.1033848774', 'pub.1135157440', 'pub.1038871730', 'pub.1125342197', 'pub.1062464920', 'pub.1035784043', 'pub.1013570579', 'pub.1017142745', 'pub.1009341182', 'pub.1071166017', 'pub.1034568952', 'pub.1039285208', 'pub.1137312128', 'pub.1128769802', 'pub.1027129217', 'pub.1060388091']"
238,Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Dental Students Seek Academically Productive Mentors,"Hossein E Jazayeri, Karan P Ganjawalla, Kevin C Lee, Brendan W Wu, R John Tannyhill",Elsevier,2019-09-05,10.1016/j.joms.2019.08.024,pub.1120862640,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a strong statistical correlation exists between the involvement of trainee groups and the academic productivity of the senior author.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of publications in the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery from 2002 to 2016 was designed and implemented. The primary predictor variables were the presence of a trainee (dental student or oral and maxillofacial surgery [OMS] resident), year of publication, and study design and topic. The outcome variable was the Hirsch index (h-index) of the senior author. Author affiliations were queried using ScienceDirect, and the Scopus database was used to identify the h-index of the senior author from each publication spanning the previous 15 years. Descriptive statistics and t tests were performed to determine significance.
RESULTS: Of the 6,398 articles published in the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery from January 2002 to December 2016, 1,341 (21.0%) met the inclusion criteria. The mean h-index of senior authors of articles with trainees or OMS residents was not significantly different from the mean h-index of senior authors without trainees (P = .50) or OMS residents (P = .37), whereas the mean h-index of senior authors working with dental students was significantly greater than the h-index of those not working with dental students (P < .01). Dental student mentors had a mean h-index that was below the sample mean from 2002 to 2007 but rose above the sample mean from 2010 to 2016. Trainees were more likely to work with academically productive mentors in orthognathic surgery (P < .01), temporomandibular joint (P < .05), retrospective cohort (P < .05), and innovative technique (P < .05) studies but less likely in randomized controlled trials (P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Dental students seek more academically productive mentors to a greater degree. More studies should be conducted to elucidate the attributes of the ideal mentor in academic OMS and to determine whether differences in mentorship exist between domestic and foreign OMS programs.",,Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,78,1,0,"['Efficiency', 'Humans', 'Mentors', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Students, Dental', 'Surgery, Oral']","['pub.1024144615', 'pub.1009454116', 'pub.1007557858', 'pub.1017220010', 'pub.1111785056', 'pub.1039413573', 'pub.1028048164', 'pub.1111679268', 'pub.1050171733', 'pub.1039362842', 'pub.1083933837', 'pub.1111443049', 'pub.1103604737', 'pub.1032502738', 'pub.1050917859', 'pub.1001676312', 'pub.1045092147', 'pub.1047448839']"
