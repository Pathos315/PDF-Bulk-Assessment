0,Behavior Analysis and Environmental Protection: Accomplishments and Potential for More,"Philip K. Lehman, E. Scott Geller",Springer Nature,2004-05-01,10.5210/bsi.v13i1.33,pub.1072708754,"The contributions and merits of an applied behavior analysis approach to encouraging pro-environment behavior are reviewed, along with a discussion of ways behavioral science can play a greater role in protecting the environment. After presenting the most serious threats to the earthâ€™s environment, the targets, settings and techniques of the behavioral intervention literature are reviewed. It is argued that behavior analysis can play a greater role in solving environmental problems through (a) reexamination and expansion of intervention targets, (b) increased focus on long-term maintenance of pro-environment behavior, and (c) more effective dissemination of intervention strategies and research findings.",,Behavior and Social Issues,13,1,184,,"['pub.1053368377', 'pub.1037690197', 'pub.1033781069', 'pub.1041017742', 'pub.1029025585', 'pub.1004777148', 'pub.1014526692', 'pub.1027970841', 'pub.1047004250', 'pub.1047924964', 'pub.1062448481', 'pub.1035833998', 'pub.1014517459', 'pub.1041578264', 'pub.1009954830', 'pub.1021293367', 'pub.1048209249', 'pub.1069273117', 'pub.1025337729', 'pub.1017377476', 'pub.1026362560', 'pub.1003648986', 'pub.1030085161', 'pub.1026460447', 'pub.1030044378', 'pub.1041250181', 'pub.1051005690', 'pub.1004127455', 'pub.1028968248', 'pub.1047562392', 'pub.1035004967', 'pub.1032170342', 'pub.1013196479', 'pub.1069271040', 'pub.1052897414', 'pub.1029664017', 'pub.1069271302', 'pub.1029551432', 'pub.1028049755', 'pub.1016649598', 'pub.1043196149', 'pub.1024368052', 'pub.1002097677', 'pub.1000286484', 'pub.1018754203', 'pub.1069278079', 'pub.1043355554', 'pub.1017397855', 'pub.1002973666', 'pub.1053585790', 'pub.1012071573', 'pub.1034520045', 'pub.1005707476', 'pub.1034096020', 'pub.1024491250', 'pub.1025444148']"
1,Conflict and Coordination in the Provision of Public Goods: A Conceptual Analysis of Continuous and Step-Level Games,"Susanne Abele, Garold Stasser, Christopher Chartier",SAGE Publications,2010-06-02,10.1177/1088868310368535,pub.1034681774,"Conflicts between individual and collective interests are ubiquitous in social life. Experimental studies have investigated the resolution of such conflicts using public goods games with either continuous or step-level payoff functions. Game theory and social interdependence theory identify consequential differences between these two types of games. Continuous function games are prime examples of social dilemmas because they always contain a conflict between individual and collective interests, whereas step-level games can be construed as social coordination games. Step-level games often provide opportunities for coordinated solutions that benefit both the collective and the individuals. For this and other reasons, the authors conclude that one cannot safely generalize results obtained from step-level to continuous-form games (or vice versa). Finally, the authors identify specific characteristics of the payoff function in public goods games that conceptually mark the transition from a pure dilemma to a coordination problem nested within a dilemma.",,Personality and Social Psychology Review,14,4,28,"['Communication', 'Conflict, Psychological', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Decision Making', 'Game Theory', 'Group Structure', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Motivation', 'Public Policy', 'Public Sector', 'Self Concept', 'Social Identification', 'Social Responsibility']","['pub.1063741174', 'pub.1045470760', 'pub.1052731855', 'pub.1037087187', 'pub.1045142327', 'pub.1034681505', 'pub.1098680883', 'pub.1002555828', 'pub.1025293489', 'pub.1004025606', 'pub.1033036737', 'pub.1002501103', 'pub.1013143800', 'pub.1009109811', 'pub.1033593429', 'pub.1048483869', 'pub.1014031821', 'pub.1036023593', 'pub.1058546435', 'pub.1041499627', 'pub.1032328463', 'pub.1022818952', 'pub.1009002498', 'pub.1046488803', 'pub.1000835642', 'pub.1015465163', 'pub.1015045367', 'pub.1019680597', 'pub.1051075208', 'pub.1012462781', 'pub.1013702671', 'pub.1050617223', 'pub.1006504236', 'pub.1002026222', 'pub.1023600022', 'pub.1014249595', 'pub.1042723142', 'pub.1069993171', 'pub.1005782787', 'pub.1046118026', 'pub.1026090196', 'pub.1046274892', 'pub.1002810773', 'pub.1039180689', 'pub.1063626456', 'pub.1064222221', 'pub.1069848810', 'pub.1003749494', 'pub.1011343128', 'pub.1012738464', 'pub.1013955276', 'pub.1019590876', 'pub.1028038344', 'pub.1010560123']"
