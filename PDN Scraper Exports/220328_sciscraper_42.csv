After presenting the most serious threats to the earth’s environment, the targets, settings and techniques of the behavioral intervention literature are reviewed. It is argued that behavior analysis can play a greater role in solving environmental problems through (a) reexamination and expansion of intervention targets, (b) increased focus on long-term maintenance of pro-environment behavior, and (c) more effective dissemination of intervention strategies and research findings.",Behavior and Social Issues,13,1,185,"Philip K.

1,Conflict and Coordination in the Provision of Public Goods: A Conceptual Analysis of Continuous and Step-Level Games,SAGE Publications,2010-06-02,10.1177/1088868310368535,pub.1034681774,"Conflicts between individual and collective interests are ubiquitous in social life. Experimental studies have investigated the resolution of such conflicts using public goods games with either continuous or step-level payoff functions. Game theory and social interdependence theory identify consequential differences between these two types of games. Continuous function games are prime examples of social dilemmas because they always contain a conflict between individual and collective interests, whereas step-level games can be construed as social coordination games. Step-level games often provide opportunities for coordinated solutions that benefit both the collective and the individuals. For this and other reasons, the authors conclude that one cannot safely generalize results obtained from step-level to continuous-form games (or vice versa). Finally, the authors identify specific characteristics of the payoff function in public goods games that conceptually mark the transition from a pure dilemma to a coordination problem nested within a dilemma.",Personality and Social Psychology Review,14,4,28,"Susanne Abele, Garold Stasser, Christopher Chartier","['Communication', 'Conflict, Psychological', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Decision Making', 'Game Theory', 'Group Structure', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Motivation', 'Public Policy', 'Public Sector', 'Self Concept', 'Social Identification', 'Social Responsibility']","['pub.1050617223', 'pub.1037087187', 'pub.1036023593', 'pub.1014031821', 'pub.1013955276', 'pub.1009109811', 'pub.1004025606', 'pub.1026090196', 'pub.1051075208', 'pub.1012738464', 'pub.1069848810', 'pub.1064222221', 'pub.1002555828', 'pub.1041499627', 'pub.1019590876', 'pub.1015465163', 'pub.1000835642', 'pub.1042723142', 'pub.1015045367', 'pub.1032328463', 'pub.1045470760', 'pub.1058546435', 'pub.1028038344', 'pub.1010560123', 'pub.1003749494', 'pub.1019680597', 'pub.1002810773', 'pub.1046488803', 'pub.1009002498', 'pub.1048483869', 'pub.1005782787', 'pub.1033593429', 'pub.1013143800', 'pub.1034681505', 'pub.1002501103', 'pub.1006504236', 'pub.1011343128', 'pub.1063741174', 'pub.1046274892', 'pub.1045142327', 'pub.1002026222', 'pub.1069993171', 'pub.1098680883', 'pub.1022818952', 'pub.1012462781', 'pub.1014249595', 'pub.1052731855', 'pub.1023600022', 'pub.1046118026', 'pub.1025293489', 'pub.1039180689', 'pub.1013702671', 'pub.1063626456', 'pub.1033036737']"

4,Fake News Detection on Social Media: A Data Mining Perspective,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),2017-09,10.1145/3137597.3137600,pub.1091623818,"Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of \fake news"", i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ine ective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging in and of itself as users' social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social media.",ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,19,1,945,"Kai Shu, Amy Sliva, Suhang Wang, Jiliang Tang, Huan Liu",,"['pub.1090852061', 'pub.1101735869', 'pub.1042746173', 'pub.1041153045', 'pub.1084228260', 'pub.1088800598', 'pub.1011559054', 'pub.1016095327', 'pub.1095074374', 'pub.1048307559', 'pub.1061585367', 'pub.1008664013', 'pub.1051409549', 'pub.1035505783', 'pub.1096882649', 'pub.1049599362', 'pub.1042172916', 'pub.1043384084', 'pub.1051048771', 'pub.1069641248', 'pub.1017623354', 'pub.1091048929', 'pub.1111476501', 'pub.1006849432', 'pub.1037480906', 'pub.1010020120', 'pub.1051002544', 'pub.1031959606', 'pub.1027576627', 'pub.1007201481', 'pub.1095379864', 'pub.1003442924', 'pub.1098653069', 'pub.1094758038', 'pub.1012795382', 'pub.1072710245', 'pub.1045278048', 'pub.1061834292', 'pub.1004596742', 'pub.1059679582', 'pub.1034374907', 'pub.1048863193', 'pub.1061698803', 'pub.1033790956', 'pub.1037388752', 'pub.1040766591', 'pub.1067368412', 'pub.1004776965', 'pub.1085983137', 'pub.1031994458', 'pub.1051646807', 'pub.1013034825', 'pub.1032150182', 'pub.1094868258']"

9,Tolerant Paternalism: Pro-ethical Design as a Resolution of the Dilemma of Toleration,Springer Nature,2015-12-09,10.1007/s11948-015-9733-2,pub.1017997618,"Toleration is one of the fundamental principles that inform the design of a democratic and liberal society. Unfortunately, its adoption seems inconsistent with the adoption of paternalistically benevolent policies, which represent a valuable mechanism to improve individuals’ well-being. In this paper, I refer to this tension as the dilemma of toleration. The dilemma is not new. It arises when an agent A would like to be tolerant and respectful towards another agent B’s choices but, at the same time, A is altruistically concerned that a particular course of action would harm, or at least not improve, B’s well-being, so A would also like to be helpful and seeks to ensure that B does not pursue such course of action, for B’s sake and even against B’s consent. In the article, I clarify the specific nature of the dilemma and show that several forms of paternalism, including those based on ethics by design and structural nudging, may not be suitable to resolve it. I then argue that one form of paternalism, based on pro-ethical design, can be compatible with toleration and hence with the respect for B’s choices, by operating only at the informational and not at the structural level of a choice architecture. This provides a successful resolution of the dilemma, showing that tolerant paternalism is not an oxymoron but a viable approach to the design of a democratic and liberal society.",Science and Engineering Ethics,22,6,32,Luciano Floridi,"['Choice Behavior', 'Humans', 'Paternalism', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Principle-Based Ethics']","['pub.1053223822', 'pub.1027353556', 'pub.1031156802', 'pub.1008794181', 'pub.1017826273', 'pub.1046752956', 'pub.1039306975', 'pub.1002136705', 'pub.1031571342', 'pub.1068846924', 'pub.1017858192', 'pub.1034131895', 'pub.1098732078', 'pub.1096909206', 'pub.1028682513', 'pub.1053528628', 'pub.1053659940', 'pub.1098666200', 'pub.1012880569', 'pub.1001967589', 'pub.1012907892', 'pub.1058603206', 'pub.1000184626', 'pub.1058712405', 'pub.1047844102', 'pub.1048233805', 'pub.1054158590', 'pub.1033700482', 'pub.1058602999', 'pub.1006182100', 'pub.1045569120', 'pub.1108570951', 'pub.1013600018', 'pub.1059973563', 'pub.1019250281', 'pub.1043909741', 'pub.1029530183']"
10,The flexibility of emotional attention: Accessible social identities guide rapid attentional orienting,Elsevier,2012-08-03,10.1016/j.cognition.2012.07.007,pub.1031401974,"There is extensive evidence that emotional-especially threatening-stimuli rapidly capture attention. These findings are often explained in terms of a hard-wired and relatively inflexible fear module. We propose an alternative, more flexible mechanism, arguing that motivational relevance is the crucial factor driving rapid attentional orienting. To test our hypothesis, we endowed initially neutral face stimuli with relevance by randomly assigning them to a social in-group or out-group during a 1-min learning phase, and used these faces as cues in a dot probe task to measure rapid attentional orienting. Across three experiments, we observed attentional orienting toward faces assigned to the out-group. Initial rapid orienting (after 100 ms, Experiments 1 and 2) was observed only for familiar faces for which group membership was explicitly encoded, suggesting that rapid orienting may be based on affectively charged memory traces. At a later time point (after 500 ms, Experiment 3), attention was deployed toward unfamiliar faces sharing a physical attribute (background color) with the familiar out-group faces, suggesting a more time-consuming on-line appraisal of the stimulus. The amount of attentional bias to out-group faces was correlated with individual differences in the accessibility of group identification. Our findings demonstrate that attentional prioritization mechanisms can be flexibly tuned by a brief learning phase of social identity. This is consistent with the idea that attention mechanisms subserving the selection and prioritization of emotional aspects of the environment are not static and hard-wired, but may rapidly adapt to recent changes in motivational contingencies.",Cognition,125,2,38,"Tobias Brosch, Jay J.

We randomly assigned participants to a mixed-race team and used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify brain regions involved in processing novel in-group and out-group members independently of preexisting attitudes, stereotypes, or familiarity. Whereas previous research on intergroup perception found amygdala activity--typically interpreted as negativity--in response to stigmatized social groups, we found greater activity in the amygdala, fusiform gyri, orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsal striatum when participants viewed novel in-group faces than when they viewed novel out-group faces. Moreover, activity in orbitofrontal cortex mediated the in-group bias in self-reported liking for the faces. These in-group biases in neural activity were not moderated by race or by whether participants explicitly attended to team membership or race, a finding suggesting that they may occur automatically.

To investigate this, we performed a large-scale behavioral experiment with live crowds from two countries. Participants (N = 3,288 in study 1 and N = 582 in study 2) were presented with a set of moral scenarios and asked to judge the acceptability of a controversial action. Then they organized in groups of three and discussed their opinions to see whether they agreed on common values of acceptability. We found that groups succeeding at reaching consensus frequently had extreme participants with low confidence and a participant with a moderate view but high confidence. Quantitative analyses showed that these ""confident grays"" exerted the greatest weight on group judgements and suggest that consensus was driven by a mediation process [7, 8]. Overall, these findings shed light on the elements that allow human groups to resolve moral disagreement.",Current Biology,29,23,5,"Joaquin Navajas, Facundo Álvarez Heduan, Juan Manuel Garrido, Pablo A Gonzalez, Gerry Garbulsky, Dan Ariely, Mariano Sigman","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Attitude', 'Consensus', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Judgment', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morals', 'Young Adult']","['pub.1004128131', 'pub.1019730656', 'pub.1109957977', 'pub.1005459636', 'pub.1024541906', 'pub.1036238369', 'pub.1102640561', 'pub.1069767316', 'pub.1013430948', 'pub.1062500571', 'pub.1003697624', 'pub.1047467064', 'pub.1003931813', 'pub.1011587233', 'pub.1041809703', 'pub.1023467997', 'pub.1049377972', 'pub.1009356957', 'pub.1013822904', 'pub.1003429922', 'pub.1100320508', 'pub.1024516059', 'pub.1016710118', 'pub.1103074520', 'pub.1017584933', 'pub.1047232737', 'pub.1039218923', 'pub.1023933791', 'pub.1033399317', 'pub.1009338801', 'pub.1110617093', 'pub.1091914175']"

While participating in a live Facebook discussion, in which two confederates created a bully–victim dynamic, we recorded and observed participants' responses. Participants also filled out a series of questionnaires including a general Facebook usage and attitude survey, a questionnaire on the discussion, the Big Five Inventory (BFI), Davis's Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men (ATLG) Scale. We found individuals high in empathy, high in extroversion, and with positive attitudes toward the homosexual community were more likely to intervene.

Experimenters have manipulated processing fluency using a vast array of techniques, which, despite their diversity, produce remarkably similar judgmental consequences. For example, people similarly judge stimuli that are semantically primed (conceptual fluency), visually clear (perceptual fluency), and phonologically simple (linguistic fluency) as more true than their less fluent counterparts. The authors offer the first comprehensive review of such mechanisms and their implications for judgment and decision making.

The fight-or-flight response is generally regarded as the prototypic human stress response, both physiologically and behaviorally. Given that having positive social interactions before being exposed to acute stress plays a preeminent role in helping individuals control their stress response, engaging in prosocial behavior in response to stress (tend-and-befriend) might also be a protective pattern. Little is known, however, about the immediate social responses following stress in humans. Here we show that participants who experienced acute social stress, induced by a standardized laboratory stressor, engaged in substantially more prosocial behavior (trust, trustworthiness, and sharing) compared with participants in a control condition, who did not experience socioevaluative threat. These effects were highly specific: Stress did not affect the readiness to exhibit antisocial behavior or to bear nonsocial risks. These results show that stress triggers social approach behavior, which operates as a potent stress-buffering strategy in humans, thereby providing evidence for the tend-and-befriend hypothesis.",Psychological Science,23,6,266,"Bernadette von Dawans, Urs Fischbacher, Clemens Kirschbaum, Ernst Fehr, Markus Heinrichs","['Cooperative Behavior', 'Games, Experimental', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Saliva', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Trust', 'Young Adult']","['pub.1031915213', 'pub.1008069185', 'pub.1025338190', 'pub.1024106179', 'pub.1017016255', 'pub.1037921816', 'pub.1016472809', 'pub.1023183353', 'pub.1048305359', 'pub.1030845792', 'pub.1020279884', 'pub.1061935888', 'pub.1041769714', 'pub.1005750542', 'pub.1006220883', 'pub.1049254175', 'pub.1027907298', 'pub.1007632158', 'pub.1040529280', 'pub.1053794628', 'pub.1026141925', 'pub.1048834010', 'pub.1024392128', 'pub.1006391759', 'pub.1022427246', 'pub.1011782550', 'pub.1062611520', 'pub.1050457307', 'pub.1019591133', 'pub.1001415137', 'pub.1043049490', 'pub.1032843265', 'pub.1046698762', 'pub.1048582769', 'pub.1037366954', 'pub.1018467987', 'pub.1052933435']"

As information proliferation-the consumption and sharing of information-increases through social media and other communications technology, these limits create an attentional bottleneck, favoring information that is more likely to be searched for, attended to, comprehended, encoded, and later reproduced. In information-rich environments, this bottleneck influences the evolution of information via four forces of cognitive selection, selecting for information that is belief-consistent, negative, social, and predictive. Selection for belief-consistent information leads balanced information to support increasingly polarized views. Selection for negative information amplifies information about downside risks and crowds out potential benefits. Selection for social information drives herding, impairs objective assessments, and reduces exploration for solutions to hard problems. Selection for predictive patterns drives overfitting, the replication crisis, and risk seeking. This article summarizes the negative implications of these forces of cognitive selection and presents eight warnings that represent severe pitfalls for the naive ""informavore,"" accelerating extremism, hysteria, herding, and the proliferation of misinformation.",Perspectives on Psychological Science,14,3,39,Thomas T.

We predicted that synchrony, due to an ability to elicit low-level appraisals of similarity, would enhance a basic compassionate response toward victims of moral transgressions and thereby increase subsequent costly helping behavior on their behalf. Using a manipulation of rhythmic synchrony, we show that synchronous others are not only perceived to be more similar to oneself but also evoke more compassion and altruistic behavior than asynchronous others experiencing the same plight. These findings both support the view that a primary function of synchrony is to mark others as similar to the self and provide the first empirical demonstration that synchrony-induced affiliation modulates emotional responding and altruism.",Emotion,11,2,344,"Piercarlo Valdesolo, David DeSteno","['Altruism', 'Crime Victims', 'Empathy', 'Humans', 'Movement', 'Time Factors']","['pub.1058795696', 'pub.1054867225', 'pub.1000778713', 'pub.1058697806', 'pub.1010948540', 'pub.1003208982', 'pub.1051855326', 'pub.1036870047', 'pub.1030526221', 'pub.1039145663', 'pub.1007341010', 'pub.1061935966', 'pub.1000293684', 'pub.1045882697', 'pub.1040831851', 'pub.1050994552', 'pub.1051599679', 'pub.1063741078', 'pub.1024180168', 'pub.1010221410', 'pub.1003824373', 'pub.1030008739']"

Such group-based prosociality may reflect either strategic considerations concerning one's own future outcomes or intrinsic value placed on the outcomes of in-group members. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, we examined vicarious reward responses to witnessing the monetary gains of in-group and out-group members, as well as prosocial behavior towards both types of individuals. We found that individuals' investment in their group-a motivational component of social identification-tracked the intensity of their responses in ventral striatum to in-group (vs out-group) members' rewards, as well as their tendency towards group-based prosociality. Individuals with strong motivational investment in their group preferred rewards for an in-group member, whereas individuals with low investment preferred rewards for an out-group member. These findings suggest that the motivational importance of social identity-beyond mere similarity to group members-influences vicarious reward and prosocial behavior. More broadly, these findings support a theoretical framework in which salient social identities can influence neural representations of subjective value, and suggest that social preferences can best be understood by examining the identity contexts in which they unfold.",Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience,12,8,46,"Leor M.

The purpose of this prospective 11-month study was to replicate this finding in an outpatient series of married women in Korea, but also to further explore the nature of PC in terms of qualities of the marital relationship and dysfunctional attitudes. The subjects consisted of 27 married female outpatients who had all been treated for major depression, but were in recovery at time of first contact or shortly after. All were interviewed at time 1 and then again after 11 months at time 2 to ascertain major depressive episode using the Korean version of SADS as well as completing the BDI. At first contact, questionnaire and interview assessments were used for marital quality and dysfunctional attitudes denoting dependency. There was a significant relationship between the single-item PC and depressive relapse at follow-up as predicted. This relationship was not enhanced by using the expanded item scale. PC and/or PC-E were significantly correlated with marital quality variables, specifically lack of emotional support from partner, negative interaction and dependence on partner. The study shows that perceived criticism by spouse is a predictor of depressive relapse in Korean outpatients and that this appears to reflect actual negative characteristics of the marital relationship as well as the depressed person's high dependence on the relationship. These results support the importance of improving marital interactions in preventing relapse in depression. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy,13,5,21,"Jung‐Hye Kwon, Yuri Lee, Min‐Soo Lee, Antonia Bifulco",,"['pub.1027540264', 'pub.1015104139', 'pub.1013504440', 'pub.1041504114', 'pub.1063483236', 'pub.1053656840', 'pub.1024416085', 'pub.1064166540', 'pub.1042708087', 'pub.1040054587', 'pub.1023361599', 'pub.1053801766', 'pub.1012801770', 'pub.1016098757', 'pub.1044277466', 'pub.1053800080', 'pub.1064165042']"
21,Multiple Paths to Belonging That We Should Study Together,SAGE Publications,2018-12-05,10.1177/1745691618803629,pub.1110410135,"We propose a broadened conceptualization of what it means to belong by reviewing evidence that there is more than one way to achieve a sense of belonging. We suggest four paths-a communal-relationship path, a general-approbation path, a group-membership path, and a minor-sociability path-and review some evidence for the existence of each. We call for researchers to recognize that multiple paths to belonging exist and to study whether and how the paths combine and interact to influence people's sense of belonging. Choosing the communal-relationship path and the general-approbation path as an example, we highlight times when these paths may (a) mesh well and produce additive boosts to a person's sense of belonging, (b) substitute for one another, and (c) conflict with one another and cause ambivalence. We further call for the development of refined measures of the need to belong and of having a sense of achieved belonging as well as new measures of striving to achieve belonging through specific paths.

22,Is race erased? Decoding race from patterns of neural activity when skin color is not diagnostic of group boundaries,Oxford University Press (OUP),2012-06-01,10.1093/scan/nss063,pub.1041455034,"Several theories suggest that people do not represent race when it does not signify group boundaries. However, race is often associated with visually salient differences in skin tone and facial features. In this study, we investigated whether race could be decoded from distributed patterns of neural activity in the fusiform gyri and early visual cortex when visual features that often covary with race were orthogonal to group membership. To this end, we used multivariate pattern analysis to examine an fMRI dataset that was collected while participants assigned to mixed-race groups categorized own-race and other-race faces as belonging to their newly assigned group. Whereas conventional univariate analyses provided no evidence of race-based responses in the fusiform gyri or early visual cortex, multivariate pattern analysis suggested that race was represented within these regions. Moreover, race was represented in the fusiform gyri to a greater extent than early visual cortex, suggesting that the fusiform gyri results do not merely reflect low-level perceptual information (e.g. color, contrast) from early visual cortex. These findings indicate that patterns of activation within specific regions of the visual cortex may represent race even when overall activation in these regions is not driven by racial information.

Moreover, the current knowledge of emotional memory enhancement is based mostly on small samples of extremely emotive stimuli presented in unnaturally high proportions without adequate affective, lexical, and semantic controls. To investigate how emotion affects memory under conditions of natural variation, we tested whether arousal and valence predicted recognition memory for over 2500 words that were not sampled for their emotionality, and we controlled a large variety of lexical and semantic factors. Both negative and positive stimuli were remembered better than neutral stimuli, whether arousing or calming. Arousal failed to predict recognition memory, either independently or interactively with valence. Results support models that posit a facilitative role of valence in memory. This study also highlights the importance of stimulus controls and experimental designs in research on emotional memory. ",Cognition,129,3,87,"James S.

25,Confidence Can Be Used to Discriminate Between Accurate and Inaccurate Lie Decisions,SAGE Publications,2019-09-20,10.1177/1745691619863431,pub.1121160171,"There is a long-standing belief that confidence is not useful at discriminating between accurate and inaccurate deception decisions. Historically, this position made sense because people showed little ability to discriminate lie-tellers from truth-tellers. But, it is now widely accepted that, under certain conditions, people can discriminate between lie-tellers and truth-tellers. Nevertheless, belief that confidence does not discriminate between accurate and inaccurate responses persists. This belief is somewhat paradoxical because, to the extent that people can discriminate between lie-tellers and truth-tellers, signal detection theory naturally predicts a positive relationship between confidence and accuracy. In line with our signal-detection-based predictions, we show that, among decisions about whether someone is lying, those made with high confidence are more accurate than those made with low confidence. This important relationship has gone unnoticed in past work because of a reliance on inappropriate measures. Past research examining the confidence-accuracy relationship in deception research relied on correlating average confidence with proportion of correctly identified lies. These correlations provide information on whether more confident judges tend to be more accurate but remain silent on the arguably more important question of whether higher confidence decisions are more accurate than lower confidence decisions. We show that confidence-accuracy characteristic analyses are uniquely suited to measuring the confidence-accuracy relationship in deception research.",Perspectives on Psychological Science,14,6,5,"Andrew M.

Although bullshit-sensitivity has been linked to other individual difference measures, it has not yet been shown to predict any actual behavior. We therefore conducted a survey study with over a thousand participants from a general sample of the Swedish population and assessed participants' bullshit-receptivity (i.e. their perceived meaningfulness of seven bullshit sentences) and profoundness-receptivity (i.e. their perceived meaningfulness of seven genuinely profound sentences), and used these variables to predict two types of prosocial behavior (self-reported donations and a decision to volunteer for charity). Despite bullshit-receptivity and profoundness-receptivity being positively correlated with each other, logistic regression analyses showed that profoundness-receptivity had a positive association whereas bullshit-receptivity had a negative association with both types of prosocial behavior. These relations held up for the most part when controlling for potentially intermediating factors such as cognitive ability, time spent completing the survey, sex, age, level of education, and religiosity.

To address this question, we meta-analyzed the results of 51 experimental studies, involving over 18,000 participants, that examined one form of partisan bias-the tendency to evaluate otherwise identical information more favorably when it supports one's political beliefs or allegiances than when it challenges those beliefs or allegiances. Two hypotheses based on previous literature were tested: an asymmetry hypothesis (predicting greater partisan bias in conservatives than in liberals) and a symmetry hypothesis (predicting equal levels of partisan bias in liberals and conservatives). Mean overall partisan bias was robust ( r = .245), and there was strong support for the symmetry hypothesis: Liberals ( r = .235) and conservatives ( r = .255) showed no difference in mean levels of bias across studies. Moderator analyses reveal this pattern to be consistent across a number of different methodological variations and political topics.

29,An intra-group perspective on leader preferences: Different risks of exploitation shape preferences for leader facial dominance,Elsevier,2016-12,10.1016/j.leaqua.2016.09.003,pub.1046891933,"This article argues that followers' preferences for dominant leadership vary according to two types of exploitation risks from other individuals within the group. Previous work demonstrates that contexts of inter-group war and peace make followers prefer dominant- and non-dominant-looking leaders, respectively. We add an intra-group perspective to this literature. Four original studies demonstrate that contexts with high risks of free-riding and criminal behavior from other group members (i.e., horizontal exploitation) increase preferences for dominant-looking leaders, whereas contexts with high risks of unresponsive, self-interested behavior from leaders themselves (i.e., vertical exploitation) decrease preferences for dominant-looking leaders. Moreover, within this framework of intra-group exploitation risks we show that followers prefer leaders from another vis-à-vis their own ethnic coalition to look less dominant, and that this difference is driven by enhanced concerns for vertical exploitation from ethnically different leaders. The findings add new insights on appearance-based voting and electoral difficulties facing minority candidates.",The Leadership Quarterly,27,6,31,"Troels Bøggild, Lasse Laustsen",,"['pub.1046377606', 'pub.1062457597', 'pub.1032357883', 'pub.1047026777', 'pub.1029814483', 'pub.1046524681', 'pub.1016364757', 'pub.1000332650', 'pub.1035412410', 'pub.1088890208', 'pub.1073386498', 'pub.1069383616', 'pub.1044391889', 'pub.1011645551', 'pub.1048839342', 'pub.1098775976', 'pub.1073364142', 'pub.1053239979', 'pub.1044806255', 'pub.1052092243', 'pub.1023624396', 'pub.1070042649', 'pub.1058851760', 'pub.1031151948', 'pub.1032220051', 'pub.1010304262', 'pub.1046383067', 'pub.1013753017', 'pub.1051801302', 'pub.1046119601', 'pub.1050935465', 'pub.1026518051', 'pub.1001749291', 'pub.1023102736', 'pub.1011328406', 'pub.1022951274', 'pub.1026283138', 'pub.1034988324', 'pub.1034868609', 'pub.1007023759', 'pub.1000608564', 'pub.1043400323', 'pub.1090661414', 'pub.1025328919', 'pub.1058524420', 'pub.1017475876', 'pub.1062459207', 'pub.1038511911', 'pub.1001526687', 'pub.1039736709', 'pub.1005929158', 'pub.1022251461', 'pub.1009281343', 'pub.1030272308', 'pub.1035320809', 'pub.1052697658', 'pub.1052769583', 'pub.1040786783', 'pub.1015166694', 'pub.1045358286', 'pub.1029928120', 'pub.1011986881', 'pub.1005913297', 'pub.1023419539', 'pub.1043825020', 'pub.1022176035', 'pub.1044649545']"
30,A Little Thanks Goes a Long Way: Explaining Why Gratitude Expressions Motivate Prosocial Behavior,American Psychological Association (APA),2010-06,10.1037/a0017935,pub.1028464291,"Although research has established that receiving expressions of gratitude increases prosocial behavior, little is known about the psychological mechanisms that mediate this effect. We propose that gratitude expressions can enhance prosocial behavior through both agentic and communal mechanisms, such that when helpers are thanked for their efforts, they experience stronger feelings of self-efficacy and social worth, which motivate them to engage in prosocial behavior. In Experiments 1 and 2, receiving a brief written expression of gratitude motivated helpers to assist both the beneficiary who expressed gratitude and a different beneficiary. These effects of gratitude expressions were mediated by perceptions of social worth and not by self-efficacy or affect. In Experiment 3, we constructively replicated these effects in a field experiment: A manager's gratitude expression increased the number of calls made by university fundraisers, which was mediated by social worth but not self-efficacy. In Experiment 4, a different measure of social worth mediated the effects of an interpersonal gratitude expression. Our results support the communal perspective rather than the agentic perspective: Gratitude expressions increase prosocial behavior by enabling individuals to feel socially valued.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,98,6,418,"Adam M.

32,Amygdala structure and the tendency to regard the social system as legitimate and desirable,Springer Nature,2017-12-04,10.1038/s41562-017-0248-5,pub.1093139687,"Individual variation in preferences to maintain versus change the societal status quo can manifest in the political realm by choosing leaders and policies that reinforce or undermine existing inequalities1. We sought to understand which individuals are likely to defend or challenge inequality in society by exploring the neuroanatomical substrates of system justification tendencies. In two independent neuroimaging studies, we observed that larger bilateral amygdala volume was positively correlated with the tendency to believe that the existing social order was legitimate and desirable. These results held for members of advantaged and disadvantaged groups (men and women, respectively). Furthermore, individuals with larger amygdala volume were less likely to participate in subsequent protest movements. We ruled out alternative explanations in terms of attitudinal extremity and political orientation per se. Exploratory whole-brain analyses suggested that system justification effects may extend to structures that are adjacent to the amygdala, including parts of the insula and the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings suggest that the amygdala may provide a neural substrate for maintaining the societal status quo, and opens avenues for further investigation into the association between system justification and other neuroanatomical regions.",Nature Human Behaviour,2,2,17,"H.

This paper outlines the tools available to choice architects, that is anyone who present people with choices. We divide these tools into two categories: those used in structuring the choice task and those used in describing the choice options. Tools for structuring the choice task address the idea of what to present to decision-makers, and tools for describing the choice options address the idea of how to present it. We discuss implementation issues in using choice architecture tools, including individual differences and errors in evaluation of choice outcomes.

Using this framework, we highlight methodological issues and go beyond net effects to examine how and when phones boost versus hurt well-being.

35,Why We Hate,SAGE Publications,2018-08-02,10.1177/1754073917751229,pub.1105984160,"We offer a functional perspective on hate, showing that hate has a unique pattern of appraisals and action tendencies. Hate is based on perceptions of a stable, negative disposition of persons or groups. We hate persons and groups more because of who they are, than because of what they do. Hate has the goal to eliminate its target. Hate is especially significant at the intergroup level, where it turns already devalued groups into victims of hate. When shared among group members, hate can spread fast in conflict zones where people are exposed to hate-based violence, which further feeds their hate. Hate can be reassuring and self-protective, because its message is simple and helps confirming people’s belief in a just world.",Emotion Review,10,4,47,"Agneta Fischer, Eran Halperin, Daphna Canetti, Alba Jasini",,"['pub.1033300148', 'pub.1008019628', 'pub.1063545874', 'pub.1042108462', 'pub.1099342977', 'pub.1033043684', 'pub.1092219499', 'pub.1029276248', 'pub.1015185366', 'pub.1045751103', 'pub.1063863953', 'pub.1024349487', 'pub.1073252957', 'pub.1051616888', 'pub.1000883302', 'pub.1030761332', 'pub.1007628509', 'pub.1042131510', 'pub.1040179415', 'pub.1034325629', 'pub.1010630549', 'pub.1013105009', 'pub.1015748974', 'pub.1007828334', 'pub.1047021981', 'pub.1049592520', 'pub.1020660172', 'pub.1048962552', 'pub.1016928184', 'pub.1004691085', 'pub.1017620307', 'pub.1110623904', 'pub.1043550149', 'pub.1114091303', 'pub.1042822472', 'pub.1013002680', 'pub.1020173037', 'pub.1054952704', 'pub.1034796521', 'pub.1063730303', 'pub.1023102736', 'pub.1063545207', 'pub.1098703488', 'pub.1030461137', 'pub.1001646430', 'pub.1027969962', 'pub.1023822897', 'pub.1006801151', 'pub.1015666865', 'pub.1044932079', 'pub.1109248584', 'pub.1044912178', 'pub.1001714168', 'pub.1013859266', 'pub.1036241709', 'pub.1039938490', 'pub.1017972204', 'pub.1023475535', 'pub.1004222110', 'pub.1005692453', 'pub.1007040775', 'pub.1034592234', 'pub.1004529512', 'pub.1038222958', 'pub.1000111846', 'pub.1017226175', 'pub.1015040328', 'pub.1031638869', 'pub.1063545875', 'pub.1011548618', 'pub.1063942940', 'pub.1073575724', 'pub.1016578472', 'pub.1031843044', 'pub.1034222454', 'pub.1098695931']"

These tendencies to care about and help one another form the foundation of human society. When the target is an outgroup member, however, people may have powerful motivations not to care about or help that “other.” In such cases, empathic responses are rare and fragile; it is easy to disrupt the chain from perception of suffering to motivation to alleviate the suffering to actual helping. We highlight recent interdisciplinary research demonstrating that outgroup members' suffering elicits dampened empathic responses as compared to ingroup members' suffering. We consider an alternative to empathy in the context of intergroup competition: schadenfreude—pleasure at others' pain. Finally, we review recent investigations of intergroup-conflict interventions that attempt to increase empathy for outgroups. We propose that researchers across the range of psychological sciences stand to gain a better understanding of the foundations of empathy by studying its limitations.",Current Directions in Psychological Science,20,3,311,"Mina Cikara, Emile G.

In this paper, we analyze a field experiment with 56,000 Wisconsin voters designed to measure the persuasive effects of canvassing, phone calls, and mailings during the 2008 presidential election. Focusing on the canvassing treatment, we find that persuasive appeals had two unintended consequences. First, they reduced responsiveness to a follow-up survey among infrequent voters, a substantively meaningful behavioral response that has the potential to induce bias in estimates of persuasion effects as well. Second, the persuasive appeals possibly reduced candidate support and almost certainly did not increase it. This counterintuitive finding is reinforced by multiple statistical methods and suggests that contact by a political campaign may engender a backlash.",Political Behavior,38,3,20,"Michael A.

38,The power of being heard: The benefits of ‘perspective-giving’ in the context of intergroup conflict,Elsevier,2012-07,10.1016/j.jesp.2012.02.017,pub.1030429926," Although hundreds of dialogue programs geared towards conflict resolution are offered every year, there have been few scientific studies of their effectiveness. Across 2 studies we examined the effect of controlled, dyadic interactions on attitudes towards the ‘other’ in members of groups involved in ideological conflict. Study 1 involved Mexican immigrants and White Americans in Arizona, and Study 2 involved Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East. Cross-group dyads interacted via video and text in a brief, structured, face-to-face exchange: one person was assigned to write about the difficulties of life in their society (‘perspective-giving’), and the second person was assigned to accurately summarize the statement of the first person (‘perspective-taking’). Positive changes in attitudes towards the outgroup were greater for Mexican immigrants and Palestinians after perspective-giving and for White Americans and Israelis after perspective-taking. For Palestinians, perspective-giving to an Israeli effectively changed attitudes towards Israelis, while a control condition in which they wrote an essay on the same topic without interacting had no effect on attitudes, illustrating the critical role of being heard. Thus, the effects of dialogue for conflict resolution depend on an interaction between dialogue condition and participants' group membership, which may reflect power asymmetries.",Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,48,4,140,"Emile G.

39,"The legacy of altruism in health care: the promotion of empathy, prosociality and humanism",Wiley,2012-02-10,10.1111/j.1365-2923.2011.04159.x,pub.1037374615,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine concepts of altruism and empathy among medical students and professionals in conjunction with health care initiatives designed to support the maintenance of these qualities.
METHODS: We searched for the terms 'altruism', 'altruistic', 'helping', 'prosocial behaviour' and 'empathy' in the English-language literature published from 1980 to the present within the Ovid MEDLINE, PsycInfo and PubMed databases. We used conceptual analysis to examine the relationships among altruism, empathy and related prosocial concepts in health care in order to understand how such factors may relate to emotional and career burnout, cynicism, decreased helping and decreased patient-centredness in care.
RESULTS: Altruistic ideals and qualities of empathy appear to decrease among some medical students as they progress through their education. During this process, students face increasingly heavy workloads, deal with strenuous demands and become more acquainted with non-humanistic informal practices inherent in the culture of medicine. In combination, these factors increase the likelihood that emotional suppression, detachment from patients, burnout and other negative consequences may result, perhaps as a means of self-preservation. Alternatively, by making a mindful and intentional choice to endeavour for self-care and a healthy work-life balance, medical students can uphold humanistic and prosocial attitudes and behaviours.
CONCLUSIONS: Promoting altruism in the context of a compensated health care career is contradictory and misguided. Instead, an approach to clinical care that is prosocial and empathic is recommended. Training in mindfulness, self-reflection and emotion skills may help medical students and professionals to recognise, regulate and behaviourally demonstrate empathy within clinical and professional encounters. However, health care initiatives to increase empathy and other humanistic qualities will be limited unless more practical and feasible emotion skills training is offered to and accepted by medical students. Success will be further moderated by the culture of medicine's full acceptance of empathy and humanism into its customs, beliefs, values, interactions and daily practices.",Medical Education,46,3,78,"Derek J Burks, Amy M Kobus","['Altruism', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Curriculum', 'Empathy', 'Humanism', 'Humans', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Self Care', 'Students, Medical']","['pub.1046538002', 'pub.1052217188', 'pub.1063494857', 'pub.1035396586', 'pub.1058383714', 'pub.1021051667', 'pub.1030200001', 'pub.1021687753', 'pub.1019228669', 'pub.1043211776', 'pub.1007242368', 'pub.1049652342', 'pub.1098728523', 'pub.1036935801', 'pub.1012611725', 'pub.1023269121', 'pub.1030887322', 'pub.1007363553', 'pub.1014139333', 'pub.1036078450', 'pub.1021477680', 'pub.1073705372', 'pub.1015035896', 'pub.1001122826', 'pub.1014467701', 'pub.1073390594', 'pub.1015174231', 'pub.1060337441', 'pub.1008891119', 'pub.1046618007', 'pub.1037260381', 'pub.1024788679', 'pub.1023967143', 'pub.1020468408', 'pub.1027452258', 'pub.1025988097', 'pub.1000293684', 'pub.1023269036', 'pub.1018327890', 'pub.1005663030', 'pub.1098773430', 'pub.1021748496', 'pub.1042462968', 'pub.1049305045', 'pub.1037790933', 'pub.1049664157', 'pub.1001827497', 'pub.1010628846', 'pub.1051643623', 'pub.1022380304', 'pub.1016861790', 'pub.1008532591', 'pub.1006376789', 'pub.1024799499', 'pub.1022584671', 'pub.1036749928', 'pub.1073340866', 'pub.1013826573', 'pub.1003993083', 'pub.1024169923', 'pub.1054161909', 'pub.1012770874', 'pub.1018303156']"

Both active interventions resulted in significant increases in happiness observable at 6 months and significant decreases in depression sustained up to 3 months. The interventions were examined in relationship to dependency and self-criticism, both related to vulnerability to depression. Individuals high in self-criticism became happier at 1 week and at 1 month in the optimism condition in the repeated measures analysis. A sensitivity test using multi-level modeling failed to replicate this effect.

Yet although theoretical and methodological advances in subtle, ""everyday"" dehumanization have progressed rapidly, blatant dehumanization remains understudied. The present research attempts to refocus theoretical and empirical attention on blatant dehumanization, examining when and why it provides explanatory power beyond subtle dehumanization. To accomplish this, we introduce and validate a blatant measure of dehumanization based on the popular depiction of evolutionary progress in the ""Ascent of Man."" We compare blatant dehumanization to established conceptualizations of subtle and implicit dehumanization, including infrahumanization, perceptions of human nature and human uniqueness, and implicit associations between ingroup-outgroup and human-animal concepts. Across 7 studies conducted in 3 countries, we demonstrate that blatant dehumanization is (a) more strongly associated with individual differences in support for hierarchy than subtle or implicit dehumanization, (b) uniquely predictive of numerous consequential attitudes and behaviors toward multiple outgroup targets, (c) predictive above prejudice, and (d) reliable over time. Finally, we show that blatant-but not subtle-dehumanization spikes immediately after incidents of real intergroup violence and strongly predicts support for aggressive actions like torture and retaliatory violence (after the Boston Marathon bombings and Woolwich attacks in England). This research extends theory on the role of dehumanization in intergroup relations and intergroup conflict and provides an intuitive, validated empirical tool to reliably measure blatant dehumanization.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,109,5,270,"Nour Kteily, Emile Bruneau, Adam Waytz, Sarah Cotterill","['Adult', 'Dehumanization', 'Female', 'Hierarchy, Social', 'Humans', 'Hungary', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Personality', 'Prejudice', 'United Kingdom', 'United States']","['pub.1056345724', 'pub.1013266114', 'pub.1000672746', 'pub.1063740489', 'pub.1048397832', 'pub.1044899188', 'pub.1019186790', 'pub.1006341153', 'pub.1038674302', 'pub.1003128136', 'pub.1015248910', 'pub.1012134269', 'pub.1033015684', 'pub.1022689479', 'pub.1047819082', 'pub.1070676593', 'pub.1064222190', 'pub.1024835253', 'pub.1007470716', 'pub.1036109505', 'pub.1064218657', 'pub.1007385585', 'pub.1009265795', 'pub.1002642791', 'pub.1027351841', 'pub.1017613780', 'pub.1007749277', 'pub.1003157785', 'pub.1023557334', 'pub.1010619982', 'pub.1025124012', 'pub.1064222269', 'pub.1020727752', 'pub.1014944040', 'pub.1028370709', 'pub.1034384172', 'pub.1041889900', 'pub.1041988023', 'pub.1034956480', 'pub.1033581499', 'pub.1067630245', 'pub.1053086472', 'pub.1047252841', 'pub.1037564152', 'pub.1013580221', 'pub.1035710213', 'pub.1064074785', 'pub.1020324440', 'pub.1018607542', 'pub.1044428042', 'pub.1029541605', 'pub.1036333113', 'pub.1023518248', 'pub.1018397736', 'pub.1001426330', 'pub.1045655105', 'pub.1052097442', 'pub.1028789136', 'pub.1036010396', 'pub.1067636495', 'pub.1021704151', 'pub.1014081446', 'pub.1010926018', 'pub.1045794326', 'pub.1011815296', 'pub.1031810791', 'pub.1015499526', 'pub.1047336976', 'pub.1021300969']"

Qualitative differences are assumed between the processes underlying both criteria. A meta-analysis of the truth effect was conducted that compared the two criteria. In all, 51 studies of the repetition-induced truth effect were included in the analysis. Results indicate that the between-items effect is larger than the within-items effect. Moderator analyses reveal that several moderators affect both effects differentially. This lends support to the notion that different psychological comparison processes may underlie the two effects. The results are discussed within the processing fluency account of the truth effect.",Personality and Social Psychology Review,14,2,254,"Alice Dechêne, Christoph Stahl, Jochim Hansen, Michaela Wänke","['Cognition', 'Communication', 'Humans', 'Judgment', 'Memory', 'Trust', 'Truth Disclosure']","['pub.1035539604', 'pub.1011278161', 'pub.1045420047', 'pub.1048779871', 'pub.1041976960', 'pub.1016191578', 'pub.1043677900', 'pub.1023735124', 'pub.1023308803', 'pub.1021960086', 'pub.1020048382', 'pub.1011957252', 'pub.1009312038', 'pub.1067636583', 'pub.1052753750', 'pub.1064222225', 'pub.1000981995', 'pub.1009423318', 'pub.1049590188', 'pub.1043151180', 'pub.1006085064', 'pub.1056368321', 'pub.1016637118', 'pub.1042113179', 'pub.1004044766', 'pub.1058528115', 'pub.1027191691', 'pub.1031820591', 'pub.1070216956', 'pub.1058640443', 'pub.1002723925', 'pub.1044170714', 'pub.1002506478', 'pub.1067636293', 'pub.1069767226', 'pub.1030278805', 'pub.1001041595', 'pub.1058529113', 'pub.1013344558', 'pub.1039415085', 'pub.1035244247', 'pub.1000913008', 'pub.1033484281', 'pub.1024421768', 'pub.1032102303', 'pub.1058714763', 'pub.1063740197', 'pub.1025885194', 'pub.1058528884', 'pub.1069487013', 'pub.1039745044', 'pub.1021319647', 'pub.1017710886', 'pub.1048280008', 'pub.1033441924', 'pub.1069486564', 'pub.1037328455', 'pub.1045118077', 'pub.1016098090', 'pub.1106804271', 'pub.1051373180', 'pub.1036892853', 'pub.1043629721', 'pub.1058528136', 'pub.1047173645', 'pub.1049436349', 'pub.1001557073', 'pub.1000345585', 'pub.1011806145', 'pub.1058528581', 'pub.1044514146', 'pub.1016449966']"

The process was mediated by participants’ general perspective-taking and sympathy abilities, which relate to the cognitive and affective routes to learning. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the process. One hundred and forty-five girls between the ages of 7 and 15 completed the self-report online survey. Findings suggest that prosocial gaming is associated with greater perspective-taking and sympathizing abilities. These abilities positively correlated with thoughts about all types of violence as wrong whether or not “justified” and independent of severity. Error correlations suggest that younger girls’ processing comprises an affective component that bypasses the cognitive or perspective-taking route. Findings also intimate that in the case of justified violence assessments, girls not only evaluated the aggressor’s violent act but also assessed what precipitated the act thus suggesting more complex thought.",Communication Research,41,7,17,Edward T.

Research on team effectiveness has focused primarily on single-discipline teams engaged in routine production tasks and, less often, on interdisciplinary teams engaged in discussion and management rather than action. The resulting models do not explain differences in learning in interdisciplinary action teams. Members of these teams must coordinate action in uncertain, fast-paced situations, and the extent to which they are comfortable speaking up with observations, questions, and concerns may critically influence team outcomes. To explore what leaders of action teams do to promote speaking up and other proactive coordination behaviours – as well as how organizational context may affect these team processes and outcomes – I analysed qualitative and quantitative data from 16 operating room teams learning to use a new technology for cardiac surgery. Team leader coaching, ease of speaking up, and boundary spanning were associated with successful technology implementation. The most effective leaders helped teams learn by communicating a motivating rationale for change and by minimizing concerns about power and status differences to promote speaking up in the service of learning.",Journal of Management Studies,40,6,970,Amy C.

These psychological biases have been empirically characterized in intergroup settings, but rarely in groups involved in active conflict. Similarly, the basic brain networks involved in recognizing others' narratives and misfortunes have been identified, but how these brain networks are modulated by intergroup conflict is largely untested. In the present study, we examined behavioural and neural responses in Arab, Israeli and South American participants while they considered the pain and suffering of individuals from each group. Arabs and Israelis reported feeling significantly less compassion for each other's pain and suffering (the 'conflict outgroup'), but did not show an ingroup bias relative to South Americans (the 'distant outgroup'). In contrast, the brain regions that respond to others' tragedies showed an ingroup bias relative to the distant outgroup but not the conflict outgroup, particularly for descriptions of emotional suffering. Over all, neural responses to conflict group members were qualitatively different from neural responses to distant group members. This is the first neuroimaging study to examine brain responses to others' suffering across both distant and conflict groups, and provides a first step towards building a foundation for the biological basis of conflict.",Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences,367,1589,55,"Emile G.

46,Social Groups Prioritize Selective Attention to Faces: How Social Identity Shapes Distractor Interference,Public Library of Science (PLoS),2016-08-24,10.1371/journal.pone.0161426,pub.1013822570,"Human faces automatically attract visual attention and this process appears to be guided by social group memberships. In two experiments, we examined how social groups guide selective attention toward in-group and out-group faces. Black and White participants detected a target letter among letter strings superimposed on faces (Experiment 1). White participants were less accurate on trials with racial out-group (Black) compared to in-group (White) distractor faces. Likewise, Black participants were less accurate on trials with racial out-group (White) compared to in-group (Black) distractor faces. However, this pattern of out-group bias was only evident under high perceptual load-when the task was visually difficult. To examine the malleability of this pattern of racial bias, a separate sample of participants were assigned to mixed-race minimal groups (Experiment 2). Participants assigned to groups were less accurate on trials with their minimal in-group members compared to minimal out-group distractor faces, regardless of race. Again, this pattern of out-group bias was only evident under high perceptual load. Taken together, these results suggest that social identity guides selective attention toward motivationally relevant social groups-shifting from out-group bias in the domain of race to in-group bias in the domain of minimal groups-when perceptual resources are scarce.",PLOS ONE,11,8,6,"Gewnhi Park, Jay J. van Bavel, LaBarron K.

Self-compassion entails: (a) being kind and understanding toward oneself in times of pain or failure, (b) perceiving one's own suffering as part of a larger human experience, and (c) holding painful feelings and thoughts in mindful awareness. In this article we review findings from personality, social, and clinical psychology related to self-compassion. First, we define self-compassion and distinguish it from other self-constructs such as self-esteem, self-pity, and self-criticism. Next, we review empirical work on the correlates of self-compassion, demonstrating that self-compassion has consistently been found to be related to well-being. These findings support the call for interventions that can raise self-compassion. We then review the theory and empirical support behind current interventions that could enhance self-compassion including compassionate mind training (CMT), imagery work, the gestalt two-chair technique, mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT).

We hypothesized that people typically know less about such policies than they think they do (the illusion of explanatory depth) and that polarized attitudes are enabled by simplistic causal models. Asking people to explain policies in detail both undermined the illusion of explanatory depth and led to attitudes that were more moderate (Experiments 1 and 2). Although these effects occurred when people were asked to generate a mechanistic explanation, they did not occur when people were instead asked to enumerate reasons for their policy preferences (Experiment 2). Finally, generating mechanistic explanations reduced donations to relevant political advocacy groups (Experiment 3).

51,Perceiving the World Through Group-Colored Glasses: A Perceptual Model of Intergroup Relations,Taylor & Francis,2016-10-24,10.1080/1047840x.2016.1199221,pub.1026934499,Extensive research has investigated societal and behavioral consequences of social group affiliation and identification but has been relatively silent on the role of perception in intergroup relations. We propose the perceptual model of intergroup relations to conceptualize how intergroup relations are grounded in perception. We review the growing literature on how intergroup dynamics shape perception across different sensory modalities and argue that these perceptual processes mediate intergroup relations. The model provides a starting point for social psychologists to study perception as a function of social group dynamics and for perception researchers to consider social influences. We highlight several gaps in the literature and outline areas for future research. Uncovering the role of perception in intergroup relations offers novel insights into the construction of shared reality and may help devise new and unique interventions targeted at the perceptual level.,Psychological Inquiry,27,4,48,"Y.

However, it is unclear which aspect of empathy is most relevant to intergroup conflict. Although trait empathic concern predicts prosociality in interpersonal settings, we hypothesized that the best predictor of meaningful <i>intergroup</i> attitudes and behaviors might not be the general capacity for empathy (i.e., trait empathy), but the difference in empathy felt for the in-group versus the out-group, or ""parochial empathy."" Specifically, we predicted that out-group empathy would inhibit intergroup harm and promote intergroup helping, whereas in-group empathy would have the opposite effect. In three intergroup contexts-Americans regarding Arabs, Hungarians regarding refugees, Greeks regarding Germans-we found support for this hypothesis.

L. Fredrickson's (1998, 2001) broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions asserts that people's daily experiences of positive emotions compound over time to build a variety of consequential personal resources. The authors tested this build hypothesis in a field experiment with working adults (n = 139), half of whom were randomly-assigned to begin a practice of loving-kindness meditation. Results showed that this meditation practice produced increases over time in daily experiences of positive emotions, which, in turn, produced increases in a wide range of personal resources (e.g., increased mindfulness, purpose in life, social support, decreased illness symptoms). In turn, these increments in personal resources predicted increased life satisfaction and reduced depressive symptoms. Discussion centers on how positive emotions are the mechanism of change for the type of mind-training practice studied here and how loving-kindness meditation is an intervention strategy that produces positive emotions in a way that outpaces the hedonic treadmill effect.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,95,5,1371,"Barbara L.

We review research on this moral self-licensing effect in the domains of political correctness, prosocial behavior, and consumer choice. We also discuss remaining theoretical tensions in the literature: Do good deeds reframe bad deeds (moral credentials) or merely balance them out (moral credits)? When does past behavior liberate and when does it constrain? Is self-licensing primarily for others’ benefit (self-presentational) or is it also a way for people to reassure themselves that they are moral people?

In the absence of individuating information, participants consistently report more empathy for members of their own assigned group than a competitive out-group. However, individualized descriptions of in-group and out-group targets significantly reduce parochial empathy by interfering with encoding of targets' group membership. Finally, the descriptions that most effectively decrease parochial empathy are those that describe targets' mental states. These results support the role of individuating information in ameliorating parochial empathy, suggest a mechanism for their action, and show that descriptions emphasizing targets' mental states are particularly effective.

57,Mechanisms of Moral Disengagement in the Exercise of Moral Agency,American Psychological Association (APA),1996,10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364,pub.1034384172,"This research examined the role of mechanisms of moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency. Regulatory self-sanctions can be selectively disengaged from detrimental conduct by converting harmful acts to moral ones through linkage to worthy purposes, obscuring personal causal agency by diffusion and displacement of responsibility, misrepresenting or disregarding the injurious effects inflicted on others, and vilifying the recipients of maltreatment by blaming and dehumanizing them. The study examined the structure and impact of moral disengagement on detrimental conduct and the psychological processes through which it exerts its effects. Path analyses reveal that moral disengagement fosters detrimental conduct by reducing prosocialness and anticipatory self-censure and by promoting cognitive and affective reactions conducive to aggression. The structure of the paths of influence is very similar for interpersonal aggression and delinquent conduct. Although the various mechanisms of moral disengagement operate in concert, moral reconstruals of harmful conduct by linking it to worthy purposes and vilification of victims seem to contribute most heavily to engagement in detrimental activities.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,71,2,1370,"Albert Bandura, Claudio Barbaranelli, Gian Vittorio Caprara, Concetta Pastorelli",,"['pub.1023770194', 'pub.1036073667', 'pub.1042883998', 'pub.1040075209', 'pub.1045175804', 'pub.1029021203', 'pub.1044162707', 'pub.1069381885', 'pub.1047859638', 'pub.1012387639', 'pub.1009459099', 'pub.1016692233', 'pub.1032991507', 'pub.1040623052', 'pub.1033772728', 'pub.1031965147', 'pub.1013641600', 'pub.1115395791', 'pub.1030346280', 'pub.1049844991', 'pub.1036333113', 'pub.1012534016', 'pub.1063714712', 'pub.1016335177', 'pub.1021704151', 'pub.1033136858']"

Given the potential for widespread dissemination of this material, we examine the individual-level characteristics associated with sharing false articles during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. To do so, we uniquely link an original survey with respondents' sharing activity as recorded in Facebook profile data. First and foremost, we find that sharing this content was a relatively rare activity. Conservatives were more likely to share articles from fake news domains, which in 2016 were largely pro-Trump in orientation, than liberals or moderates. We also find a strong age effect, which persists after controlling for partisanship and ideology: On average, users over 65 shared nearly seven times as many articles from fake news domains as the youngest age group.",Science Advances,5,1,362,"Andrew Guess, Jonathan Nagler, Joshua Tucker",,"['pub.1085467005', 'pub.1101714686', 'pub.1069364594', 'pub.1043852700', 'pub.1101380916', 'pub.1107188281', 'pub.1002803578', 'pub.1046615384', 'pub.1063872567', 'pub.1048145081', 'pub.1085319721', 'pub.1058714763', 'pub.1063872681', 'pub.1133389621', 'pub.1108038460', 'pub.1059969283', 'pub.1101382661', 'pub.1100275373', 'pub.1005286289']"
59,Is identifying with a historically victimized group good or bad for your health? Transgenerational post‐traumatic stress and collective victimization,Wiley,2011-09-27,10.1002/ejsp.844,pub.1052545077,"An abundance of evidence suggests that the consequences of collective ingroup victimization can traverse generations, even among group members who are not direct descendants of victims. It nevertheless remains unclear why only some group members experience vicarious victimization. To examine the role of collective identification in the transmission of trauma across generations, we surveyed members of a Jewish community—including descendants of holocaust survivors and others who were not descendants of the holocaust survivors. Among non-descendants, Jewish identification was negatively associated with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In contrast, among descendants, Jewish identification was positively associated with PTSD symptoms. Further, familial willingness to discuss the holocaust mediated the relationship between identification and PTSD symptoms. Additional analyses confirmed that these effects were specific to holocaust-related PTSD symptoms and not general anxiety or depression. These findings suggest that collective identity may both buffer and enhance the effects of collective victimization on mental health.

Many experiments have manipulated reliance on intuition in behavioral-dishonesty tasks, with mixed results. We present two meta-analyses (with evidential value) testing whether an intuitive mind-set affects the proportion of liars (<i>k</i> = 73; <i>n</i> = 12,711) and the magnitude of lying (<i>k</i> = 50; <i>n</i> = 6,473). The results indicate that when dishonesty harms <i>abstract others</i>, promoting intuition causes more people to lie, log odds ratio = 0.38, <i>p</i> = .0004, and people to lie more, Hedges's <i>g</i> = 0.26, <i>p</i> &lt; .0001. However, when dishonesty inflicts harm on <i>concrete others</i>, promoting intuition has no significant effect on dishonesty (<i>p</i> &gt; .63). We propose one potential explanation: The intuitive appeal of prosociality may cancel out the intuitive selfish appeal of dishonesty, suggesting that the social consequences of lying could be a promising key to the riddle of intuition's role in honesty.

This perspective can induce resistance against the idea that people are implicitly biased and complicates research on implicit bias. I put forward an alternative perspective that views implicit bias as a behavioral phenomenon. more specifically, it is seen as behavior that is automatically influenced by cues indicative of the social group to which others belong. This behavioral perspective is less likely to evoke resistance because implicit bias is seen as something that people do rather than possess and because it clearly separates the behavioral phenomenon from its normative implications. Moreover, performance on experimental tasks such as the Implicit Association Test is seen an instance of implicitly biased behavior rather than a proxy of hidden mental biases. Because these tasks allow for experimental control, they provide ideal tools for studying the automatic impact of social cues on behavior, for predicting other instances of biased behavior, and for educating people about implicitly biased behavior. The behavioral perspective not only changes the way we think about implicit bias but also shifts the aims of research on implicit bias and reveals links with other behavioral approaches such as network modeling.",Perspectives on Psychological Science,14,5,30,Jan De Houwer,"['Awareness', 'Cognition', 'Cues', 'Emotions', 'Humans', 'Prejudice', 'Stereotyping', 'Thinking']","['pub.1049794877', 'pub.1000940934', 'pub.1003494653', 'pub.1020793343', 'pub.1030179645', 'pub.1024256034', 'pub.1026539171', 'pub.1050839558', 'pub.1050611424', 'pub.1018524028', 'pub.1014339327', 'pub.1015970724', 'pub.1007107801', 'pub.1100591811', 'pub.1010926018', 'pub.1015125330', 'pub.1092705865', 'pub.1024603668']"

In the current study, we directly compared neural responses to others' physical pain and emotional suffering by presenting participants (n = 41) with 96 verbal stories, each describing a protagonist's physical and/or emotional experience, ranging from neutral to extremely negative. A separate group of participants rated ""how much physical pain"", and ""how much emotional suffering"" the protagonist experienced in each story, as well as how ""vivid and movie-like"" the story was. Although ratings of Pain, Suffering and Vividness were positively correlated with each other across stories, item-analyses revealed that each scale was correlated with activity in distinct brain regions. Even within regions of the ""Shared Pain network"" identified using a separate data set, responses to others' physical pain and emotional suffering were distinct.

However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call ""moral contagion."" Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (<i>n</i> = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,114,28,271,"William J.

Advocates for science need effective rebuttal strategies and are concerned about backfire effects in public debates. We conducted six experiments to assess how to mitigate the influence of a denier on the audience. An internal meta-analysis across all the experiments revealed that not responding to science deniers has a negative effect on attitudes towards behaviours favoured by science (for example, vaccination) and intentions to perform these behaviours. Providing the facts about the topic or uncovering the rhetorical techniques typical for denialism had positive effects. We found no evidence that complex combinations of topic and technique rebuttals are more effective than single strategies, nor that rebutting science denialism in public discussions backfires, not even in vulnerable groups (for example, US conservatives). As science deniers use the same rhetoric across domains, uncovering their rhetorical techniques is an effective and economic addition to the advocates’ toolbox.",Nature Human Behaviour,3,9,60,"Philipp Schmid, Cornelia Betsch","['Anti-Vaccination Movement', 'Attitude', 'Communication', 'Dissent and Disputes', 'Humans', 'Politics', 'Science']","['pub.1000316587', 'pub.1021109724', 'pub.1018683597', 'pub.1008450196', 'pub.1002342070', 'pub.1031268374', 'pub.1044876357', 'pub.1010543686', 'pub.1044692085', 'pub.1025480821', 'pub.1083406816', 'pub.1033100757', 'pub.1009805646', 'pub.1063545716', 'pub.1040448810', 'pub.1063904733', 'pub.1092129630', 'pub.1014944040', 'pub.1074211097', 'pub.1006849432', 'pub.1104160117', 'pub.1084085028', 'pub.1022213435', 'pub.1101382661', 'pub.1021573206', 'pub.1033821900', 'pub.1051151238', 'pub.1085183675', 'pub.1037392896', 'pub.1086344868', 'pub.1092039970', 'pub.1101144161', 'pub.1019488062', 'pub.1035648552', 'pub.1099637589', 'pub.1091161253', 'pub.1004431199', 'pub.1046875445', 'pub.1007177403', 'pub.1011735216', 'pub.1058528967', 'pub.1009808654', 'pub.1085370131', 'pub.1036675508', 'pub.1090830214', 'pub.1000345585', 'pub.1085463512', 'pub.1027833458']"

We claim that the moral acceptability of nudges hinges in part on whether they can provide an account of the competence required to offer nudges, an account that would serve to warrant our general trust in choice architects. What needs to be considered, on a methodological level, is whether they have clarified the competence required for choice architects to prompt subtly our behaviour toward making choices that are in our best interest from our own perspectives. We argue that, among other features, an account of the competence required to offer nudges would have to clarify why it is reasonable to expect that choice architects can understand the constraints imposed by semantic variance. Semantic variance refers to the diverse perceptions of meaning, tied to differences in identity and context, that influence how users interpret nudges.

Many youth in care receive psychological and/or psychotropic treatment but not all require or are willing to accept that level of intervention. For many, a “mental health” approach feels pathologizing. Nevertheless, these youth have suffered maltreatment and interventions to improve their ability to cope with past trauma and their often uncertain present are clearly needed. Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) provides an alternative perspective on suffering and can be framed as a wellness intervention that is appropriate for all humans. The present study examined whether a 6-week CBCT intervention would improve psychosocial functioning among adolescents in foster care. Seventy adolescents were randomized to CBCT (twice weekly) or a wait-list condition. Youth were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks. Groups did not differ on measures of psychosocial functioning following training; however practice frequency was associated with increased hopefulness and a trend for a decrease in generalized anxiety. Qualitative results indicated that participants found CBCT useful for dealing with daily life stressors. Adolescents in care were willing to engage in CBCT. The majority reported CBCT was very helpful and almost all reported they would recommend CBCT to a friend. Participants reported specific instances of using CBCT strategies to regulate emotion, manage stress, or to respond more compassionately towards others. Standardized self-report measures were not sensitive to qualitative reports of improved functioning, suggesting the need for measures more sensitive to the positive changes noted or longer training periods to demonstrate effects. Practical issues surrounding implementation of such programs in high-risk youth populations are identified. Recommendations are provided for further development.",Journal of Child and Family Studies,22,2,73,"Sheethal D. Reddy, Lobsang Tenzin Negi, Brooke Dodson-Lavelle, Brendan Ozawa-de Silva, Thaddeus W.

                  Media stories often reach citizens via a two-step process, transmitted to them indirectly via their social networks. Why are some media stories strongly transmitted and impact opinions powerfully in this two-step flow while others quickly perish? Integrating classical research on the two-step flow of political communication and novel theories from cognitive psychology, this article outlines a model for understanding the strength of political frames in the two-step flow. It argues that frames that resonate with cognitive biases (that is, deep-seated psychological decision rules) will be transmitted more and have a stronger influence on opinion when citizens recollect media frames in their social networks. Focusing on the case of episodic and thematic frames, the study tests this model. It introduces a novel research design: implementing the children’s game ‘Telephone’ in consecutive experimental online surveys fielded to nationally representative samples. This design helps gauge the reliability of transmission and the degree of persuasiveness in actual chains of transmission.",British Journal of Political Science,50,4,11,"Lene Aarøe, Michael Bang Petersen",,"['pub.1028920863', 'pub.1038044545', 'pub.1034720737', 'pub.1043938622', 'pub.1020327287', 'pub.1011334304', 'pub.1017259449', 'pub.1093158964', 'pub.1052035049', 'pub.1099541188', 'pub.1026830413', 'pub.1001988003', 'pub.1002324707', 'pub.1029179442', 'pub.1015463045', 'pub.1019735431', 'pub.1051542323', 'pub.1005497152', 'pub.1069669306', 'pub.1020133113', 'pub.1062457750', 'pub.1070052087', 'pub.1023832919', 'pub.1000697221', 'pub.1046195762', 'pub.1029188107', 'pub.1070052124', 'pub.1069767376', 'pub.1009390632', 'pub.1091088588', 'pub.1002739575', 'pub.1022412793', 'pub.1067636033', 'pub.1004496004', 'pub.1034320767', 'pub.1020816892', 'pub.1063872924', 'pub.1058577300', 'pub.1018365195', 'pub.1041465129', 'pub.1098574705', 'pub.1059679624', 'pub.1058579868', 'pub.1012214540', 'pub.1029510466', 'pub.1027448942', 'pub.1007815848', 'pub.1120682663', 'pub.1052697658', 'pub.1058548711', 'pub.1098679764', 'pub.1024485008', 'pub.1003815765', 'pub.1029230111', 'pub.1062510354', 'pub.1070052091', 'pub.1021294571']"

New evidence, however, has challenged this view by demonstrating that emotions, contrary to diseases, spread selectively rather than blindly because their transfer is controlled by social factors. Here, we take a closer look at this top-down social control of emotional contagion. We review literature on the moderating role of social factors in emotional contagion and emotional mimicry, a process often considered a basic mechanism of emotional contagion. We argue that top-down social processes controlling emotional mimicry may be explained by the correction hypothesis formulated to account for contrast effects in priming research. We also analyze whether similar corrective processes may be involved in less automatic mechanisms of emotional contagion, such as social appraisal. Finally, we propose that the modulating effects of social factors on emotional contagion and its mechanisms, similar to priming effects, may be interpreted within the framework of dual-process theories.",Perspectives on Psychological Science,14,3,22,"Monika Wróbel, Kamil K.

Using a within-subject paradigm with a small-scale experiment ( N = 29) and a larger scale replication ( N = 161), we find that Hungarian preservice teachers consistently discriminate against Roma minority students by recommending that they be denied entry to higher track secondary schools, and preferentially placing them into lower track schools, relative to equally qualified ethnic majority Hungarian students, and that the severity of the ethnic tracking bias is predicted by dehumanization (but not prejudice).

75,At the heart of morality lies neuro-visceral integration: lower cardiac vagal tone predicts utilitarian moral judgment,Oxford University Press (OUP),2016-06-17,10.1093/scan/nsw077,pub.1060023817,"To not harm others is widely considered the most basic element of human morality. The aversion to harm others can be either rooted in the outcomes of an action (utilitarianism) or reactions to the action itself (deontology). We speculated that the human moral judgments rely on the integration of neural computations of harm and visceral reactions. The present research examined whether utilitarian or deontological aspects of moral judgment are associated with cardiac vagal tone, a physiological proxy for neuro-visceral integration. We investigated the relationship between cardiac vagal tone and moral judgment by using a mix of moral dilemmas, mathematical modeling and psychophysiological measures. An index of bipolar deontology-utilitarianism was correlated with resting heart rate variability (HRV)-an index of cardiac vagal tone-such that more utilitarian judgments were associated with lower HRV. Follow-up analyses using process dissociation, which independently quantifies utilitarian and deontological moral inclinations, provided further evidence that utilitarian (but not deontological) judgments were associated with lower HRV.

76,A Double Standard When Group Members Behave Badly: Transgression Credit to Ingroup Leaders,American Psychological Association (APA),2013-11,10.1037/a0033600,pub.1017425543,"This research tested the hypothesis that people forgive serious transgressions by ingroup leaders but not by other group members or outgroup leaders. They apply a double standard in judgments of ingroup leaders. A series of studies (N = 623), using an array of different ingroups and outgroups, tested how group members judged ingroup or outgroup leaders and nonleaders who unexpectedly transgressed or did not transgress in important intergroup scenarios. Experiments 1, 2, and 4 focused on captains and players in either soccer or netball sports competitions. Across studies, transgressive captains of ingroup teams were evaluated more favorably than captains from outgroup teams and (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) more favorably than transgressive ingroup players. Experiment 3 demonstrated the double standard in a minimal group paradigm. Experiment 5 showed that the double standard is only applied if the leader is perceived as serving the group's interest. Across studies, the double standard is evident in evaluations toward, inclusion and punishment of, and rewards to the transgressive targets.

The authors review the literature on the potential of guilt, sympathy, and outrage to transform advantaged groups' apathy into positive action. They place this research into a novel framework by exploring the ways these emotions shape group processes to produce action strategies that emphasize either social cohesion or social change. These prosocial emotions have a critical but underrecognized role in creating contexts of in-group inclusion or exclusion, shaping normative content and meaning, and informing group interests. Furthermore, these distinctions provide a useful way of differentiating commonly discussed emotions. The authors conclude that the most ""effective"" emotion will depend on the context of the inequality but that outrage seems particularly likely to productively shape group processes and social change outcomes.",Personality and Social Psychology Review,13,4,178,"Emma F.

We examined how touching an inanimate object—a teddy bear—might impact the effect of social exclusion on prosocial behavior. Across two studies, we found that socially excluded individuals who touched a teddy bear acted more prosocially as compared to socially excluded individuals who just viewed the teddy bear from a distance. This effect was only observed for socially excluded participants and not for socially included (or control) participants. Overall, the findings suggest that touching a teddy bear mitigates the negative effects of social exclusion to increase prosocial behavior. In Study 2, positive emotion was found to mediate the relationship between touch and prosocial behavior.

To consider tolerance toward a different group, the elements are assigned one of the two flags, A or B, and the elements of each group can be tolerant or intolerant. Two additional parameters, p and q, respectively, characterize the propensity of elements to cooperate and the propensity of tolerants to reject intolerant attitudes. We find that (1) parameter q does not affect the degree of conflict at the micro level, but has an important influence on the degree of conflict in the whole system; (2) segregation into two cliques occurs whenever there exists intolerants in both groups; (3) when intolerants are present in only one of the groups, segregation can be avoided for appropriate combinations of parameters p and q that depend on the fraction of intolerants and the size of the groups; (4) as the size of the system increases, two balanced solutions dominate: segregation into two cliques or the isolation of intolerants; and (5) endemic partially balanced configurations are observed in large systems.",Journal of Conflict Resolution,59,1,7,"Fernando Aguiar, Antonio Parravano",,"['pub.1013628712', 'pub.1062904419', 'pub.1060033493', 'pub.1013632580', 'pub.1042001190', 'pub.1063625424', 'pub.1060741869', 'pub.1051618886', 'pub.1023312502', 'pub.1004053617', 'pub.1007389266', 'pub.1053660125', 'pub.1025450790', 'pub.1026758119', 'pub.1025851069', 'pub.1031453470', 'pub.1000697221', 'pub.1016304115', 'pub.1051722460', 'pub.1014768888', 'pub.1062895539', 'pub.1058909178', 'pub.1039702076', 'pub.1023736854', 'pub.1109721220', 'pub.1015225856', 'pub.1035181004', 'pub.1041041491', 'pub.1027934917']"
80,The effects of matching a persuasive message to a recipient&#x27;s self-concept on attitude change,National Library of Serbia,2010,10.2298/psi1003233b,pub.1046952427,"The paper addresses the question of whether matching a persuasive message to a recipient's self-concept can enhance message processing. A large body of experiments within the Elaboration likelihood model proved that framing a message so as to be perceived as selfrelevant led to more careful argument scrutiny. In this research, we matched the messages with previously assessed need for cognition - tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive tasks. Two possible sources of motivation to process a persuasive message were hereby confronted: dispositional (cognitive style) and situational (matching). Results showed a significant attitude change, but the main hypothesis was not confirmed: matched messages did not produce more argument processing activity than the mismatched. Manipulations did not have any significant effects on message processing of the high need for cognition participants. Contrary to expectations, participants low in their need for cognition elaborated the message more carefully when it was mismatched, that is when the message addressed them as persons inclined to careful thinking. Results can be explained within the framework of self-affirmation theory, which argues that providing people with an opportunity to affirm their sense of selfworth makes them more open to persuasion attempts, as well as more objective. Results are discussed from a wider theoretical and empirical perspective of motivation.

These patterns are stronger for women than men in both cultures. In support of the theory, Study 1 showed that positive and negative emotions are strongly correlated inversely for American women and weakly correlated inversely for American men, but strongly correlated positively for Chinese women and weakly correlated positively for Chinese men.

We articulate why and how identification with political parties - known as partisanship - can bias information processing in the human brain. There is extensive evidence that people engage in motivated political reasoning, but recent research suggests that partisanship can alter memory, implicit evaluation, and even perceptual judgments. We propose an identity-based model of belief for understanding the influence of partisanship on these cognitive processes.

Participants read an editorial in support of implementing comprehensive exams at their university. Experiment 1 shows that hedges placed on data statements (and not interpretation statements) lead to negative perceptions of the policy, source, and argument. This is especially pronounced on source evaluations among individuals with more scientific training. Experiment 2 reveals that colloquial, but not professional, hedges placed on interpretation statements lead to more negative evaluations relative to no hedges. Data related to perceptions of the source are moderated by individual differences in scientific reasoning. This research suggests that hedges describing data statements and/or that use colloquial language can, but do not always, undermine persuasive attempts.",Journal of Language and Social Psychology,27,3,24,"Amanda M.

We report a meta-analysis of previous tests in the psychological sciences and conduct, for the first time, a series of tests in nationally representative samples collected in the United States and Denmark that integrate the role of disgust and the behavioral immune system into established models of emotional processing and political attitude formation.

While research has demonstrated that compassion training has positive effects on mood and health, we do not know whether it also leads to increases in prosocial behavior. We addressed this question in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we introduce a new prosocial game, the Zurich Prosocial Game (ZPG), which allows for repeated, ecologically valid assessment of prosocial behavior and is sensitive to the influence of reciprocity, helping cost, and distress cues on helping behavior. Experiment 2 shows that helping behavior in the ZPG increased in participants who had received short-term compassion training, but not in participants who had received short-term memory training. Interindividual differences in practice duration were specifically related to changes in the amount of helping under no-reciprocity conditions. Our results provide first evidence for the positive impact of short-term compassion training on prosocial behavior towards strangers in a training-unrelated task.",PLOS ONE,6,3,264,"Susanne Leiberg, Olga Klimecki, Tania Singer","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Empathy', 'Female', 'Games, Experimental', 'Helping Behavior', 'Humans', 'Memory', 'Social Behavior', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']","['pub.1050007761', 'pub.1056344179', 'pub.1016839230', 'pub.1043211776', 'pub.1051075208', 'pub.1058697806', 'pub.1073430258', 'pub.1001190435', 'pub.1034296153', 'pub.1027493325', 'pub.1024265563', 'pub.1010948540', 'pub.1062570913', 'pub.1038397909', 'pub.1022216198', 'pub.1005352384', 'pub.1051785745', 'pub.1021967948', 'pub.1087380308', 'pub.1099737800', 'pub.1020468408', 'pub.1028076600', 'pub.1041889900', 'pub.1053311550', 'pub.1004921170', 'pub.1017310132', 'pub.1045687490', 'pub.1043073258', 'pub.1002798409', 'pub.1023335727', 'pub.1024380056', 'pub.1013881286', 'pub.1018850763', 'pub.1042035372', 'pub.1033012697', 'pub.1009133514', 'pub.1002326689', 'pub.1005023483', 'pub.1073421911', 'pub.1042042999', 'pub.1031652932', 'pub.1031881889', 'pub.1021980780', 'pub.1099253265', 'pub.1046752197', 'pub.1063787954', 'pub.1045562275', 'pub.1008361611', 'pub.1024715998', 'pub.1024520282', 'pub.1041399650', 'pub.1021392798', 'pub.1004419004']"

87,Reducing dehumanisation outcomes towards Blacks: The role of multiple categorisation and of human identity,Wiley,2012-11-09,10.1002/ejsp.1902,pub.1021862228,"This contribution addresses the issue of reduction of dehumanisation towards Blacks, an outgroup that has been historically targeted by heinous prejudice. The study tested, for the first time, whether the combination of multiple categorisation and human identity represents the most optimal condition for reducing dehumanisation towards Blacks. The main dependent variables were attribution of secondary emotions and inalienability of human rights. Results highlighted the combination of multiple categorisation and human identity as the most effective strategy in reducing dehumanisation towards Blacks. Evidence of this study sheds light on the possible ways through which conceiving others in terms of complex categorical criteria, that is, as members of the human group in conjunction with other communal or different social categories, can lead to more harmonious intergroup relations.

88,Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pain: Causes and Consequences of Unequal Care,Elsevier,2009-12,10.1016/j.jpain.2009.10.002,pub.1004803297,"The purpose of our review is to evaluate critically the recent literature on racial and ethnic disparities in pain and to determine how far we have come toward reducing and eliminating disparities in pain. We examined peer-reviewed research articles published between 1990 and early 2009 that focused on racial and ethnic disparities in pain in the United States. The databases used were PubMed, Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycInfo. The probable causes of minority group disparities in pain are discussed, along with suggested strategies for eliminating pain-related disparities. This review reveals the persistence of racial and ethnic disparities in acute, chronic, cancer, and palliative pain care across the lifespan and treatment settings, with minorities receiving lesser quality pain care than non-Hispanic whites. Although health and health care disparities attract local, state, and federal attention, disparities in pain care continue to be missing from publicized public health agendas and health care reform plans. Ensuring optimal pain care for all is critically important from a public health and policy perspective. A robust research program on disparities in pain is needed, and the results must be successfully translated into practices and policies specifically designed to reduce and eliminate disparities in care.
PERSPECTIVE: This review evaluates the recent literature on racial and ethnic disparities in pain and pain treatment.

89,Psychological targeting as an effective approach to digital mass persuasion,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2017-11-13,10.1073/pnas.1710966114,pub.1092669605,"People are exposed to persuasive communication across many different contexts: Governments, companies, and political parties use persuasive appeals to encourage people to eat healthier, purchase a particular product, or vote for a specific candidate. Laboratory studies show that such persuasive appeals are more effective in influencing behavior when they are tailored to individuals' unique psychological characteristics. However, the investigation of large-scale psychological persuasion in the real world has been hindered by the questionnaire-based nature of psychological assessment. Recent research, however, shows that people's psychological characteristics can be accurately predicted from their digital footprints, such as their Facebook Likes or Tweets. Capitalizing on this form of psychological assessment from digital footprints, we test the effects of psychological persuasion on people's actual behavior in an ecologically valid setting. In three field experiments that reached over 3.5 million individuals with psychologically tailored advertising, we find that matching the content of persuasive appeals to individuals' psychological characteristics significantly altered their behavior as measured by clicks and purchases. Persuasive appeals that were matched to people's extraversion or openness-to-experience level resulted in up to 40% more clicks and up to 50% more purchases than their mismatching or unpersonalized counterparts. Our findings suggest that the application of psychological targeting makes it possible to influence the behavior of large groups of people by tailoring persuasive appeals to the psychological needs of the target audiences. We discuss both the potential benefits of this method for helping individuals make better decisions and the potential pitfalls related to manipulation and privacy.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,114,48,291,"S.

In the current research, we explored the relationship between intergroup threat, physical distance, and discrimination. Specifically, we examined how intergroup threat alters estimates of physical distance to out-groups and how physical proximity affects intergroup relations. Previous research has found that people judge threatening out-groups as physically close. In Studies 1 and 2, we examined ways to attenuate this bias. In Study 1 a secure (vs. permeable) US-Mexico border reduced the estimated proximity to Mexico City among Americans who felt threatened by Mexican immigration. In Study 2, intergroup apologies reduced estimates of physical proximity to a threatening cross-town rival university, but only among participants with cross-group friendships. In Study 3, New York Yankees fans who received an experimental induction of physical proximity to a threatening out-group (Boston Red Sox) had a stronger relationship between their collective identification with the New York Yankees and support for discriminatory policies toward members of the out-group (Red Sox fans) as well as how far they chose to sit from out-group members (Red Sox fans). Together, these studies suggest that intergroup threat alters judgment of physical properties, which has important implications for intergroup relations. ",PLOS ONE,11,7,9,"Y. Jenny Xiao, Michael J.

The phrasing of survey items was varied to frame voting either as the enactment of a personal identity (e.g., ""being a voter"") or as simply a behavior (e.g., ""voting""). As predicted, the personal-identity phrasing significantly increased interest in registering to vote (experiment 1) and, in two statewide elections in the United States, voter turnout as assessed by official state records (experiments 2 and 3). These results provide evidence that people are continually managing their self-concepts, seeking to assume or affirm valued personal identities.

The present study examines the prospective positive relationship between concurrent positive and negative emotional experience and psychological well-being in the context of psychotherapy.
METHODS: 47 adults undergoing psychotherapy completed measures of psychological well-being and wrote private narratives that were coded by trained raters for emotional content.
RESULTS: The specific concurrent experience of happiness and sadness was associated with improvements in psychological well-being above and beyond the impact of the passage of time, personality traits, or the independent effects of happiness and sadness. Changes in mixed emotional experience preceded improvements in well-being.

Two experiments examined the influence of interaction roles, and the social scripts they trigger, on White participants' anxiety during dyadic interactions with Black partners. Results from both studies reveal that White participants exhibited greater discomfort in Black-White interactions than in same-race interactions unless their interaction role offered an accessible script to guide behavior. Thus, the present findings suggest organizations may be able to attenuate anxiety among White employees by (a) providing opportunities for initial Black-White interactions in settings with clearly defined social scripts for behavior and (b) helping them to develop behavioral scripts for naturally occurring Black-White workplace interactions.",Journal of Applied Psychology,94,6,80,"Derek R.

Age-related linear increases were found for both emotional empathy (self-reported empathic concern and cardiac and electrodermal responding) and prosocial behavior (size of contribution) across both films and in self-reported personal distress to the distressing film. Empathic concern and cardiac reactivity to both films, along with personal distress to the distressing film only, were associated with greater prosocial behavior.

However, studies show that some individuals are more predisposed to think, feel and act in a more ethical manner because of a lower threshold to experience guilt. Some theories of helping behaviour emphasize the evolutionary mechanisms, while other theories stress the importance of social variables. This study investigated whether guilt proneness as a dispositional trait can be associated with prosocial behaviour. Five hundred sixty-nine participants reported in an online survey their own levels of guilt proneness, frequency of prosocial behaviour, and related cognitions such as empathy. This study is among the first to demonstrate how guilt proneness combined with empathy can explain additional variance in prosocial behaviour. The findings also indicate gender differences in the precursors of prosocial behaviour, suggesting women are more influenced by the effects of guilt proneness on prosocial behaviour than men.

96,"Elevation, an emotion for prosocial contagion, is experienced more strongly by those with greater expectations of the cooperativeness of others",Public Library of Science (PLoS),2019-12-04,10.1371/journal.pone.0226071,pub.1123133428,"A unique emotion, elevation, is thought to underlie prosocial contagion, a process whereby witnessing a prosocial act leads to acting prosocially. Individuals differ in their propensity to experience elevation, and thus their proneness to prosocial contagion, but little is known about the causes of such variation. We introduce an adaptationist model wherein elevation marks immediate circumstances in which generalized prosociality is advantageous, with this evaluation of circumstances hinging in part on prior expectations of others' prosociality. In 15 studies, we add to evidence that elevation can reliably be elicited and mediates prosocial contagion. Importantly, we confirm a novel prediction-generated by our adaptationist account-that an idealistic attitude, which indexes others' expected degree of prosociality, moderates the relationship between exposure to prosocial cues and experiencing elevation. We discuss how our findings inform both basic theorizing in the affective sciences and translational efforts to engineer a more harmonious world, and we offer future research directions to further test and extend our model.",PLOS ONE,14,12,6,"Adam Maxwell Sparks, Daniel M.

97,Difference Matters: Teaching Students a Contextual Theory of Difference Can Help Them Succeed,SAGE Publications,2018-12-19,10.1177/1745691618797957,pub.1110790483,"Today's increasingly diverse and divided world requires the ability to understand and navigate across social-group differences. We propose that interventions that teach students about these differences can not only improve all students' intergroup skills but also help disadvantaged students succeed in school. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, this article theorizes that teaching students a contextual understanding of difference can accomplish both of these important goals. Understanding difference as contextual means recognizing that social-group differences come from participating in and adapting to diverse sociocultural contexts. This article begins by reviewing research that highlights two distinct understandings of social-group differences-as contextual or essential-and demonstrates their consequences for intergroup outcomes. We then review research on multicultural and social justice education that highlights the potential benefits of educating students about social-group differences. We propose that these educational approaches are associated with intergroup and academic benefits for one key reason: They teach students a contextual theory of difference. Finally, to illustrate and provide causal evidence for our theory of how a contextual understanding of difference affords these benefits, this article provides an overview of the first social psychological intervention to teach students a contextual understanding of difference: difference-education.",Perspectives on Psychological Science,14,2,13,"Nicole M.

99,Brain-to-Brain Synchrony Tracks Real-World Dynamic Group Interactions in the Classroom,Elsevier,2017-04-27,10.1016/j.cub.2017.04.002,pub.1085075225,"The human brain has evolved for group living [1]. Yet we know so little about how it supports dynamic group interactions that the study of real-world social exchanges has been dubbed the ""dark matter of social neuroscience"" [2]. Recently, various studies have begun to approach this question by comparing brain responses of multiple individuals during a variety of (semi-naturalistic) tasks [3-15]. These experiments reveal how stimulus properties [13], individual differences [14], and contextual factors [15] may underpin similarities and differences in neural activity across people. However, most studies to date suffer from various limitations: they often lack direct face-to-face interaction between participants, are typically limited to dyads, do not investigate social dynamics across time, and, crucially, they rarely study social behavior under naturalistic circumstances. Here we extend such experimentation drastically, beyond dyads and beyond laboratory walls, to identify neural markers of group engagement during dynamic real-world group interactions. We used portable electroencephalogram (EEG) to simultaneously record brain activity from a class of 12 high school students over the course of a semester (11 classes) during regular classroom activities (Figures 1A-1C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S1). A novel analysis technique to assess group-based neural coherence demonstrates that the extent to which brain activity is synchronized across students predicts both student class engagement and social dynamics. This suggests that brain-to-brain synchrony is a possible neural marker for dynamic social interactions, likely driven by shared attention mechanisms. This study validates a promising new method to investigate the neuroscience of group interactions in ecologically natural settings.",Current Biology,27,9,284,"Suzanne Dikker, Lu Wan, Ido Davidesco, Lisa Kaggen, Matthias Oostrik, James McClintock, Jess Rowland, Georgios Michalareas, Jay J.

We also examined whether eudaimonic behaviors were more strongly related to well-being than behaviors directed toward obtaining pleasure or material goods. In both studies, eudaimonic behaviors had consistently stronger relations to well-being than hedonic behaviors. Data also provided support for a temporal sequence in which eudaimonic behaviors were related to greater well-being the next day.

101,An fMRI investigation of empathy for &#x27;social pain&#x27; and subsequent prosocial behavior.,Elsevier,2010-11-28,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.11.060,pub.1020669853,"Despite empathy's importance for promoting social interactions, neuroimaging research has largely overlooked empathy during social experiences. Here, we examined neural activity during empathy for social exclusion and assessed how empathy-related neural processes might relate to subsequent prosocial behavior toward the excluded victim. During an fMRI scan, participants observed one person being excluded by two others, and afterwards sent emails to each of these 'people.' Later, a group of raters assessed how prosocial (e.g., helpful, comforting) the emails were. Observing exclusion (vs. inclusion) activated regions associated with mentalizing (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus), and highly empathic individuals activated both mentalizing regions and social pain-related regions (anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Additionally, the empathy-related activity in the anterior insula and medial prefrontal cortex was associated with later prosocial behavior toward the victim, and exploratory mediation analyses indicated that medial prefrontal cortex activity, in particular, may support the link between trait empathy and prosocial behavior. Overall, findings suggest that empathy-related neural responses to social experiences may promote spontaneous prosocial treatment of those in need.",NeuroImage,55,1,312,"Carrie L Masten, Sylvia A Morelli, Naomi I Eisenberger","['Adolescent', 'Brain', 'Empathy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Pain', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Isolation', 'Young Adult']","['pub.1062567448', 'pub.1018561088', 'pub.1030761931', 'pub.1019193132', 'pub.1043211776', 'pub.1039168583', 'pub.1001350569', 'pub.1041112934', 'pub.1016040518', 'pub.1008660773', 'pub.1032279279', 'pub.1027454506', 'pub.1031431597', 'pub.1092130014', 'pub.1053459118', 'pub.1031993936', 'pub.1024012146', 'pub.1043037330', 'pub.1073310413', 'pub.1015658247', 'pub.1025307593', 'pub.1031358225', 'pub.1024271257', 'pub.1016185448', 'pub.1036499403', 'pub.1041957695', 'pub.1039835369', 'pub.1003257032', 'pub.1041889900', 'pub.1010637831', 'pub.1043481747', 'pub.1021715840', 'pub.1049134255', 'pub.1037816762', 'pub.1003898980', 'pub.1003894630', 'pub.1004298540', 'pub.1003729526', 'pub.1032938333', 'pub.1069382255', 'pub.1045722756', 'pub.1033128388', 'pub.1008904046', 'pub.1031135915', 'pub.1000658928', 'pub.1062448522', 'pub.1049779085', 'pub.1070069775', 'pub.1012010225', 'pub.1020999000']"

This study examined moral identity as a mediator between adolescent religiosity and adolescent empathy and aggression. Participants were 502 adolescents (10–18 years) who completed an online survey. Structural equation models assessed links between religiosity (commitment and involvement) and interpersonal relationships (aggression and empathy), as well as the role of moral identity as a mediator, and the potential interactions between the two facets of religiosity. The study found indirect relationships between religious commitment and aggression and empathy by way of moral identity. Religious commitment was also directly related to empathy. Additionally, religious commitment and involvement interacted in predicting moral identity. Findings suggest that moral identity may be one mechanism by which religiosity leads to positive social interactions.

Regulatory self-sanctions can be selectively disengaged from detrimental conduct by converting harmful acts to moral ones through linkage to worthy purposes, obscuring personal causal agency by diffusion and displacement of responsibility, misrepresenting or disregarding the injurious effects inflicted on others, and vilifying the recipients of maltreatment by blaming and dehumanizing them. The study examined the structure and impact of moral disengagement on detrimental conduct and the psychological processes through which it exerts its effects. Path analyses reveal that moral disengagement fosters detrimental conduct by reducing prosocialness and anticipatory self-censure and by promoting cognitive and affective reactions conducive to aggression. The structure of the paths of influence is very similar for interpersonal aggression and delinquent conduct. Although the various mechanisms of moral disengagement operate in concert, moral reconstruals of harmful conduct by linking it to worthy purposes and vilification of victims seem to contribute most heavily to engagement in detrimental activities.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,71,2,1370,"Albert Bandura, Claudio Barbaranelli, Gian Vittorio Caprara, Concetta Pastorelli",,"['pub.1023770194', 'pub.1036073667', 'pub.1042883998', 'pub.1040075209', 'pub.1045175804', 'pub.1029021203', 'pub.1044162707', 'pub.1069381885', 'pub.1047859638', 'pub.1012387639', 'pub.1009459099', 'pub.1016692233', 'pub.1032991507', 'pub.1040623052', 'pub.1033772728', 'pub.1031965147', 'pub.1013641600', 'pub.1115395791', 'pub.1030346280', 'pub.1049844991', 'pub.1036333113', 'pub.1012534016', 'pub.1063714712', 'pub.1016335177', 'pub.1021704151', 'pub.1033136858']"

However, studies show that some individuals are more predisposed to think, feel and act in a more ethical manner because of a lower threshold to experience guilt. Some theories of helping behaviour emphasize the evolutionary mechanisms, while other theories stress the importance of social variables. This study investigated whether guilt proneness as a dispositional trait can be associated with prosocial behaviour. Five hundred sixty-nine participants reported in an online survey their own levels of guilt proneness, frequency of prosocial behaviour, and related cognitions such as empathy. This study is among the first to demonstrate how guilt proneness combined with empathy can explain additional variance in prosocial behaviour. The findings also indicate gender differences in the precursors of prosocial behaviour, suggesting women are more influenced by the effects of guilt proneness on prosocial behaviour than men.

109,Is identifying with a historically victimized group good or bad for your health? Transgenerational post‐traumatic stress and collective victimization,Wiley,2011-09-27,10.1002/ejsp.844,pub.1052545077,"An abundance of evidence suggests that the consequences of collective ingroup victimization can traverse generations, even among group members who are not direct descendants of victims. It nevertheless remains unclear why only some group members experience vicarious victimization. To examine the role of collective identification in the transmission of trauma across generations, we surveyed members of a Jewish community—including descendants of holocaust survivors and others who were not descendants of the holocaust survivors. Among non-descendants, Jewish identification was negatively associated with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In contrast, among descendants, Jewish identification was positively associated with PTSD symptoms. Further, familial willingness to discuss the holocaust mediated the relationship between identification and PTSD symptoms. Additional analyses confirmed that these effects were specific to holocaust-related PTSD symptoms and not general anxiety or depression. These findings suggest that collective identity may both buffer and enhance the effects of collective victimization on mental health.

                  Media stories often reach citizens via a two-step process, transmitted to them indirectly via their social networks. Why are some media stories strongly transmitted and impact opinions powerfully in this two-step flow while others quickly perish? Integrating classical research on the two-step flow of political communication and novel theories from cognitive psychology, this article outlines a model for understanding the strength of political frames in the two-step flow. It argues that frames that resonate with cognitive biases (that is, deep-seated psychological decision rules) will be transmitted more and have a stronger influence on opinion when citizens recollect media frames in their social networks. Focusing on the case of episodic and thematic frames, the study tests this model. It introduces a novel research design: implementing the children’s game ‘Telephone’ in consecutive experimental online surveys fielded to nationally representative samples.

111,"The causal cognition of wrong doing: incest, intentionality, and morality",Frontiers,2015-02-18,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00136,pub.1009804549,"The paper concerns the role of intentionality in reasoning about wrong doing. Anthropologists have claimed that, in certain non-Western societies, people ignore whether an act of wrong doing is committed intentionally or accidentally. To examine this proposition, we look at the case of Madagascar. We start by analyzing how Malagasy people respond to incest, and we find that in this case they do not seem to take intentionality into account: catastrophic consequences follow even if those who commit incest are not aware that they are related as kin; punishment befalls on innocent people; and the whole community is responsible for repairing the damage. However, by looking at how people reason about other types of wrong doing, we show that the role of intentionality is well understood, and that in fact this is so even in the case of incest. We therefore argue that, when people contemplate incest and its consequences, they simultaneously consider two quite different issues: the issue of intentionality and blame, and the much more troubling and dumbfounding issue of what society would be like if incest were to be permitted. This entails such a fundamental attack on kinship and on the very basis of society that issues of intentionality and blame become irrelevant. Using the insights we derive from this Malagasy case study, we re-examine the results of Haidt's psychological experiment on moral dumbfoundedness, which uses a story about incest between siblings as one of its test scenarios. We suggest that the dumbfoundedness that was documented among North American students may be explained by the same kind of complexity that we found in Madagascar. In light of this, we discuss the methodological limitations of experimental protocols, which are unable to grasp multiple levels of response. We also note the limitations of anthropological methods and the benefits of closer cross-disciplinary collaboration.

Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation5–7. Here, we attempt to address both of these questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy—and therefore they fail to implement a strongly held preference for accurate sharing.

We predicted that beyond conveying the contents of a person's mind, a person's speech also conveys mental capacity, such that hearing a person explain his or her beliefs makes the person seem more mentally capable-and therefore seem to possess more uniquely human mental traits-than reading the same content. We expected this effect to emerge when people are perceived as relatively mindless, such as when they disagree with the evaluator's own beliefs. Three experiments involving polarizing attitudinal issues and political opinions supported these hypotheses. A fourth experiment identified paralinguistic cues in the human voice that convey basic mental capacities. These results suggest that the medium through which people communicate may systematically influence the impressions they form of each other.

Classification of social media content is a fundamental task for social media mining, and most existing methods regard it as a text categorization problem and mainly focus on using content features, such as words and hashtags. However, for many emerging applications like fake news and rumor detection, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to identify useful features from content. For example, intentional spreaders of fake news may manipulate the content to make it look like real news. To address this problem, this paper concentrates on modeling the propagation of messages in a social network. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, TraceMiner, to (1) infer embeddings of social media users with social network structures; and (2) utilize an LSTM-RNN to represent and classify propagation pathways of a message. Since content information is sparse and noisy on social media, adopting TraceMiner allows to provide a high degree of classification accuracy even in the absence of content information. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the superiority over state-of-the-art approaches on the task of fake news detection and news categorization.",,,,126,"Liang Wu, Huan Liu",,"['pub.1027753925', 'pub.1021605644', 'pub.1025120983', 'pub.1052907302', 'pub.1096882649', 'pub.1049599362', 'pub.1015038119', 'pub.1015658513', 'pub.1024858448', 'pub.1035157989', 'pub.1037912856', 'pub.1061517701', 'pub.1017623354', 'pub.1026387080', 'pub.1021899069', 'pub.1100885481', 'pub.1091623818']"

In a first survey experiment (N=1,015), we demonstrate a disconnect between accuracy judgments and sharing intentions: Even though true headlines are rated as much more accurate than false headlines, headline veracity has little impact on sharing. Although this may seem to indicate that people share inaccurate content because, for example, they care more about furthering their political agenda than they care about truth, we propose an alternative attentional account: Most people do not want to spread misinformation, but the social media context focuses their attention on factors other than truth and accuracy. Indeed, when directly asked, most participants say it is important to only share news that is accurate. Accordingly, across four survey experiments (total N=3,485) and a digital field experiment on Twitter in which we messaged users who had previously shared news from websites known for publishing misleading content (N=5,379), we find that subtly inducing people to think about accuracy increases the quality of the news they subsequently share. These results, together with additional computational analyses, challenge the narrative that people no longer care about accuracy. Instead, the findings support our inattention-based account wherein people fail to implement their preference for accuracy due to attentional constraints – particularly on social media. Furthermore, our research provides evidence for scalable anti-misinformation interventions that are easily implementable by social media platforms.</p>",PsyArXiv,,,28,"Gordon Pennycook, Ziv Epstein, Mohsen Mosleh, Antonio Alonso Arechar, Dean Eckles, David Gertler Rand",,

The purpose of this article is to comprehensively examine game-play research to identify the factors that contribute to these disparate well-being outcomes and to highlight the potential positive effects. On the basis of existing literature, we argue that the effects of gaming on well-being are moderated by other variables, such as motivations for gaming and video-game characteristics. Specifically, the inclusion of social activity can benefit prosocial behaviors and affect the relationship between violent video games and aggression that some studies have demonstrated. Moreover, the research on the relationship between violent video games and aggression depends greatly on individual and sociocontextual variables outside of game play. The inclusion of physical activity in games can provide an improvement in physical health with high levels of enjoyment, potentially increasing adherence rates. Overall, following our review, we determined that the effects of gaming on well-being are moderated by and depend on the motivation for gaming, outside variables, the presence of violence, social interaction, and physical activity.

123,Does Transparency in Moderation Really Matter?,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),2019-11-07,10.1145/3359252,pub.1122420469,"When posts are removed on a social media platform, users may or may not receive an explanation. What kinds of explanations are provided? Do those explanations matter? Using a sample of 32 million Reddit posts, we characterize the removal explanations that are provided to Redditors, and link them to measures of subsequent user behaviors---including future post submissions and future post removals. Adopting a topic modeling approach, we show that removal explanations often provide information that educate users about the social norms of the community, thereby (theoretically) preparing them to become a productive member. We build regression models that show evidence of removal explanations playing a role in future user activity. Most importantly, we show that offering explanations for content moderation reduces the odds of future post removals. Additionally, explanations provided by human moderators did not have a significant advantage over explanations provided by bots for reducing future post removals. We propose design solutions that can promote the efficient use of explanation mechanisms, reflecting on how automated moderation tools can contribute to this space. Overall, our findings suggest that removal explanations may be under-utilized in moderation practices, and it is potentially worthwhile for community managers to invest time and resources into providing them.",Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,3,CSCW,35,"Shagun Jhaver, Amy Bruckman, Eric Gilbert",,"['pub.1074801401', 'pub.1035899566', 'pub.1107972092', 'pub.1048856358', 'pub.1103568374', 'pub.1045116482', 'pub.1005224912', 'pub.1024395943', 'pub.1099609866', 'pub.1017336700', 'pub.1111376776', 'pub.1024147303', 'pub.1020619557', 'pub.1103568690', 'pub.1107972081', 'pub.1039457670', 'pub.1026604690', 'pub.1118122260', 'pub.1100826332', 'pub.1039557276', 'pub.1103568864', 'pub.1010127757', 'pub.1101698142', 'pub.1046304259', 'pub.1113814481', 'pub.1048448893', 'pub.1107972253', 'pub.1041113164', 'pub.1034221386', 'pub.1105673613', 'pub.1085188629', 'pub.1083900279', 'pub.1048686134', 'pub.1048677036', 'pub.1053251882', 'pub.1101089637', 'pub.1108951341', 'pub.1035655520']"
124,Community Interaction and Conflict on the Web,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),2018,10.1145/3178876.3186141,pub.1109352325,"Users organize themselves into communities on web platforms. These communities can interact with one another, often leading to conflicts and toxic interactions. However, little is known about the mechanisms of interactions between communities and how they impact users. Here we study intercommunity interactions across 36,000 communities on Reddit, examining cases where users of one community are mobilized by negative sentiment to comment in another community. We show that such conflicts tend to be initiated by a handful of communities---less than 1% of communities start 74% of conflicts. While conflicts tend to be initiated by highly active community members, they are carried out by significantly less active members. We find that conflicts are marked by formation of echo chambers, where users primarily talk to other users from their own community. In the long-term, conflicts have adverse effects and reduce the overall activity of users in the targeted communities. Our analysis of user interactions also suggests strategies for mitigating the negative impact of conflicts---such as increasing direct engagement between attackers and defenders. Further, we accurately predict whether a conflict will occur by creating a novel LSTM model that combines graph embeddings, user, community, and text features. This model can be used to create an early-warning system for community moderators to prevent conflicts. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of community interactions and conflict, and paves the way towards healthier online communities.",,,,88,"Srijan Kumar, William L.
